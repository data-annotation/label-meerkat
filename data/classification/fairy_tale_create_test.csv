lucky-andrew,"There was once a rich peasant who had two sons, named John Nicholas and Lucky Andrew."
lucky-andrew,The oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can quite make head or tail.
lucky-andrew,"He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with, and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are, as a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with these attractive qualities."
lucky-andrew,"The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high spirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might be, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star."
lucky-andrew,"When the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face till the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a lucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet."
lucky-andrew,"Did his boat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him hanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and asked him how he felt, he would reply: ""O, quite well. I have been saved. I surely am in luck!"""
lucky-andrew,"When their father died, both of them were of age, and not long after they both had to go out to the sand-banks to fetch some fishing-nets, which had been left there since the summer fishing."
lucky-andrew,"It was late in the fall, after the time when most fishermen are busy with the summer fishing."
lucky-andrew,"Andrew had his gun along, which he carried with him wherever he went."
lucky-andrew,John Nicholas did not say much while they were underway; but he thought all the harder.
lucky-andrew,They were not ready to set out for home again until near evening.
lucky-andrew,"""Hark, Lucky Andrew, do you know there will be a storm to-night?"" said John Nicholas, and looked out across the sea."
lucky-andrew,"""I think it would be best if we stayed here until morning!"""
lucky-andrew,"""There'll be no storm,"" said Andrew."
lucky-andrew,"""The Seven Sisters have not put on their fog-caps, so you may be quite at rest."""
lucky-andrew,"But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to remain there for the night."
lucky-andrew,"When Andrew awoke he found himself alone; and he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point of the island."
lucky-andrew,"Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a sea-gull."
lucky-andrew,Andrew did not understand the whole affair.
lucky-andrew,"There were still provisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other things."
lucky-andrew,So Andrew wasted but little time in thought.
lucky-andrew,"""He will come back this evening,"" said he."
lucky-andrew,"""Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat."""
lucky-andrew,"But in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited day by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it."
lucky-andrew,"And such was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his homeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew had been drowned."
lucky-andrew,But the latter did not lose heart.
lucky-andrew,"He gathered drift-wood along the strand, shot sea-birds, and looked for mussels and roots."
lucky-andrew,"He built himself a raft of drift-timber, and fished with a pole that had also been left behind."
lucky-andrew,"One day, while he was at work, he happened to notice a depression or hollow in the sand, as though made by the keel of a large Northland schooner, and he could plainly trace the braidings of the hawsers from the strand up to the top of the island."
lucky-andrew,"Then he thought to himself that he was in no danger, for he saw there was truth in the report he had often heard, that the meer-folk made the island their abode, and did much business with their ships."
lucky-andrew,"""God be praised for good company! That was just what I needed. Yes, it is true, as I have always said, that I was born under a lucky star,"" thought Andrew to himself; perhaps he said so too, for occasionally he really had to talk a little."
lucky-andrew,So he lived through the fall.
lucky-andrew,"Once he saw a boat, and hung a rag on a pole and waved with it; but that very moment the sail dropped, and the crew took to the oars and rowed away at top speed, for they thought the meer-trolls were making signs and waving."
lucky-andrew,"On Christmas Eve Andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea; and when he came out, he saw a glow of light that came from a great Northland schooner, which was gliding toward the land--yet such a ship he had never yet seen."
lucky-andrew,"It has a main-sail of uncommon size, which looked to him to be of silk, and the most delicate tackling, as thin as though woven of steel wire, and everything else was in proportion, as fine and handsome as any Northlander might wish to have."
lucky-andrew,"The whole schooner was filled with little people dressed in blue, but the girl who stood at the helm was adorned like a bride, and looked as splendid as a queen, for she wore a crown and costly garments."
lucky-andrew,"Yet any one could see that she was a human being, for she was tall, and handsomer than the meer-folk."
lucky-andrew,"In fact, Lucky Andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever had seen."
lucky-andrew,"The schooner headed for the land where Andrew stood; but with his usual presence of mind, he hurried to the fisherman's hut, pulled down his gun from the wall, and crept up into the large loft and hid himself, so that he could see all that passed in the hut."
lucky-andrew,He soon noticed that the whole room was alive with people.
lucky-andrew,"They filled it completely and more, and still more of them came in."
lucky-andrew,"Then the walls began to crack, and the little hut spread out at all corners, and grew so splendid and magnificent that the wealthiest merchant could not have had its equal; it was almost like being in a royal castle."
lucky-andrew,Tables were covered with the most exquisite silver and gold.
lucky-andrew,When they had eaten they began to dance.
lucky-andrew,"Under cover of the noise, Andrew crept to the look-out at the side of the roof, and climbed down."
lucky-andrew,"Then he ran to the schooner, threw his flint-stone over it, and in order to make certain, cut a cross into it with his sharp-cutting knife."
lucky-andrew,"When he came back again, the dance was in full swing."
lucky-andrew,"The tables were dancing and the benches and chairs--everything else in the room was dancing, too."
lucky-andrew,"The only one who did not dance was the bride; she only sat there and looked on, and when the bridegroom came to fetch her, she sent him away."
lucky-andrew,For the moment there was no thought of stopping.
lucky-andrew,"The fiddler knew neither rest nor repose, and did not pass his cap, but played merrily on with his left hand, and beat time with his foot, until he was dripping with sweat, and the fiddle was hidden by the dust and smoke."
lucky-andrew,"When Andrew noticed that his own feet began to twitch where he was standing, he thought to himself: ""Now I had better shoot away, or else he will play me right off the ground!"""
lucky-andrew,"So he turned his gun, thrust it through the window, and shot it off over the bride's head; but upside down, otherwise the bullet would have hit him."
lucky-andrew,"The moment the shot crashed, all the troll-folk tumbled out of the door together; but when they saw that the schooner was banned on the shore, they wailed and crept into a hole in the hill."
lucky-andrew,"But all the gold and silver dishes were left behind, and the bride, too, was still sitting there."
lucky-andrew,She told Lucky Andrew that she had been carried into the hill when she was only a small child.
lucky-andrew,"Once, when her mother had gone to the pen to attend to the milking, she had taken her along; but when she had to go home for a moment, she left the child sitting under a juniper-bush, and told her that she might eat the berries if she only repeated three times: ""I eat juniper-berries blue, Wherein Jesu's cross I view. I eat whortle-berries red, Since 'twas for my sake He bled!""  But after her mother had gone, she found so many berries that she forgot to say her verse, and so she was enchanted and taken into the hill. And there no harm had been done her, save that she had lost the top joint of the little finger of her left hand, and the goblins had been kind to her; yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it should be, she felt as though something weighed upon her, and she had suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for her husband. When Andrew learned who her mother and her people were, he saw that they were related to him, and they became very good friends. So Andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star. Then they sailed home, and took along the schooner, and all the gold and silver, and all the treasure which had been left in the hut, and then Andrew was far wealthier than his brother. But the latter, who suspected where all this wealth had come from, did not wish to be any poorer than Andrew. He knew that trolls and goblins walk mainly on Christmas Eve, and for that reason he sailed out to the sand banks at that time. And on Christmas Eve he did see a light or fire, but it seemed to be like will-o'-the-wisps fluttering about."
lucky-andrew,"When he came nearer he heard splashes, horrible howls, and cold, piercing cries, and there was a smell of slime and sea-weed, as at ebb-tide."
lucky-andrew,"Terrified, he ran up into the hut, from whence he could see the trolls on the shore."
lucky-andrew,"They were short and thick like hay-ricks, completely covered with fur, with kirtles of skins, fishing boots, and enormous fist-gloves."
lucky-andrew,In place of head and hair they had bundles of sea-weed.
lucky-andrew,"When they crawled up from the strand there was a gleam behind them like that of rotting wood, and when they shook themselves they showered sparks about them."
lucky-andrew,"When they drew nearer, John Nicholas crawled up into the loft as his brother had done."
lucky-andrew,"The goblins dragged a great stone into the hut, and began to beat their gloves dry against it, and meanwhile they screamed so that John Nicholas's blood turned to ice in his hiding-place."
lucky-andrew,"Then one of them sneezed into the ashes on the hearth in order to make the fire burn again; while the others carried in heather-grass and drift-wood, as coarse and heavy as lead."
lucky-andrew,"The smoke and the heat nearly killed the eavesdropper in the loft, and in order to catch his breath and get some fresh air, he tried to crawl out of the look-out in the roof; yet he was of much heavier build than his brother, stuck fast and could move neither in nor out."
lucky-andrew,"Then he grew frightened and began to scream; but the goblins screamed much louder, and roared and howled, and thumped and clamored inside and outside the hut."
lucky-andrew,"But when the cock crowed they disappeared, and John Nicholas freed himself, too."
lucky-andrew,"Yet when he returned home from his trip, he had lost his reason, and after that the same cold, sinister screams which are the mark of the troll in the Northland, might often be heard sounding from store-rooms and lofts where he happened to be."
lucky-andrew,"Before his death, however, his reason returned, and he was buried in consecrated ground, as they say."
lucky-andrew,But after that time no human foot ever trod the sand-banks again.
lucky-andrew,"They sank, and the meer-folk, it is believed, went to the Lekang Islands."
lucky-andrew,"Andrew's luck held good; no ship made more successful trips than his own; but whenever he came to the Lekang Islands he lay becalmed--the goblins went aboard or ashore with their goods--but after a time he had fair winds, whether he happened to want to go to Bergen, or sail home."
lucky-andrew,"He had many children, and all of them were bright and vigorous, yet every one of them lacked the upper joint of the little finger of his left hand."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Long, long ago, in old Japan, the Kingdom of the Sea was governed by a wonderful King."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"He was called Rin Jin, or the Dragon King of the Sea."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"His power was immense, for he was the ruler of all sea creatures both great and small, and in his keeping were the Jewels of the Ebb and Flow of the Tide."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The Jewel of the Ebbing Tide when thrown into the ocean caused the sea to recede from the land, and the Jewel of the Flowing Tide made the waves to rise mountains high and to flow in upon the shore like a tidal wave."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The Palace of Rin Jin was at the bottom of the sea, and was so beautiful that no one has ever seen anything like it even in dreams."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The walls were of coral, the roof of jadestone and chrysoprase, and the floors were of the finest mother-of-pearl."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"But the Dragon King, in spite of his wide-spreading Kingdom, his beautiful Palace and all its wonders, and his power which none disputed throughout the whole sea, was not at all happy, for he reigned alone."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"At last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier, but also more powerful."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,So he decided to take a wife.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Calling all his fish retainers together, he chose several of them as ambassadors to go through the sea and seek for a young Dragon Princess who would be his bride."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,At last they returned to the Palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Her scales were of glittering green like the wings of summer beetles, her eyes threw out glances of fire, and she was dressed in gorgeous robes."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The King fell in love with her at once, and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendor."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Every living thing in the sea, from the great whales down to the little shrimps, came in shoals to offer their congratulations to the bride and bridegroom and to wish them a long and prosperous life."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the Fish-World before.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,The train of bearers who carried the bride's possessions to her new home seemed to reach across the waves from one end of the sea to the other.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Each fish carried a phosphorescent lantern and was dressed in ceremonial robes, gleaming blue and pink and silver; and the waves as they rose and fell and broke that night seemed to be rolling masses of white and green fire, for the phosphorus shone with double brilliancy in honor of the event."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Now for a time the Dragon King and his bride lived very happily.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"They loved each other dearly, and the bridegroom day after day took delight in showing his bride all the wonders and treasures of his coral Palace, and she was never tired of wandering with him through its vast halls and gardens."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Life seemed to them both like a long summer's day.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Two months passed in this happy way, and then the Dragon Queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The King was sorely troubled when he saw his precious bride so ill, and at once sent for the fish doctor to come and give her some medicine."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"He gave special orders to the servants to nurse her carefully and to wait upon her with diligence, but in spite of all the nurses' assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed, the young Queen showed no signs of recovery, but grew daily worse."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Then the Dragon King interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the Queen.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The doctor was alarmed at Rin Jin's evident displeasure, and excused his want of skill by saying that although he knew the right kind of medicine to give the invalid, it was impossible to find it in the sea."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Do you mean to tell me that you can't get the medicine here?"" asked the Dragon King."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""It is just as you say!"" said the doctor."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Tell me what it is you want for the Queen?"" demanded Rin Jin."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I want the liver of a live monkey!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,answered the doctor.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""The liver of a live monkey! Of course that will be most difficult to get,"" said the King."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""If we could only get that for the Queen, Her Majesty would soon recover,"" said the doctor."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Very well, that decides it; we MUST get it somehow or other. But where are we most likely to find a monkey?"" asked the King."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Then the doctor told the Dragon King that some distance to the south there was a Monkey Island where a great many monkeys lived.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""If only you could capture one of these monkeys?"" said the doctor."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""How can any of my people capture a monkey?"" said the Dragon King, greatly puzzled."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""The monkeys live on dry land, while we live in the water; and out of our element we are quite powerless! I don't see what we can do!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""That has been my difficulty too,"" said the doctor."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""But amongst your innumerable servants you surely can find one who can go on shore for that express purpose!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Something must be done,"" said the King, and calling his chief steward he consulted him on the matter."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The chief steward thought for some time, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, said joyfully: ""I know what we must do! There is the kurage (jelly fish). He is certainly ugly to look at, but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise. Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one."""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The jelly fish was then summoned to the King's presence, and was told by His Majesty what was required of him."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The jelly fish, on being told of the unexpected mission which was to be intrusted to him, looked very troubled, and said that he had never been to the island in question, and as he had never had any experience in catching monkeys he was afraid that he would not be able to get one."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Well,"" said the chief steward, ""if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never catch a monkey. The only way is to play a trick on one!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""How can I play a trick on a monkey? I don't know how to do it,"" said the perplexed jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""This is what you must do,"" said the wily chief steward."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""When you approach the Island of Monkeys and meet some of them, you must try to get very friendly with one. Tell him that you are a servant of the Dragon King, and invite him to come and visit you and see the Dragon King's Palace. Try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the Palace and the wonders of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""But how am I to get the monkey here? You know monkeys don't swim?"" said the reluctant jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""You must carry him on your back. What is the use of your shell if you can't do that!"" said the chief steward."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Won't he be very heavy?"" queried kurage again."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""You mustn't mind that, for you are working for the Dragon King,"" replied the chief steward."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I will do my best then,"" said the jelly fish, and he swam away from the Palace and started off towards the Monkey Island."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours, and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,On looking round he saw not far away a big pine-tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking for-a live monkey.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I'm in luck!"" thought the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Now I must flatter the creature and try to entice him to come back with me to the Palace, and my part will be done!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,So the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,In those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"When he got to the pine-tree he raised his voice and said: ""How do you do, Mr. Monkey? Isn't it a lovely day?"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""A very fine day,"" answered the monkey from the tree."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I have never seen you in this part of the world before. Where have you come from and what is your name?"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""My name is kurage or jelly fish. I am one of the servants of the Dragon King. I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it,"" answered the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I am very glad to see you,"" said the monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""By the bye,"" said the jelly fish, ""have you ever seen the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea where I live?"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!"" answered the monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. The beauty of the Palace is beyond all description-it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world,"" said the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Is it so beautiful as all that?"" asked the monkey in astonishment."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Then the jelly fish saw his chance, and went on describing to the best of his ability the beauty and grandeur of the Sea King's Palace, and the wonders of the garden with its curious trees of white, pink and red coral, and the still more curious fruits like great jewels hanging on the branches."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The monkey grew more and more interested, and as he listened he came down the tree step by step so as not to lose a word of the wonderful story."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I have got him at last!"" thought the jelly fish, but aloud he said: ""Mr. Monkey. I must now go back. As you have never seen the Palace of the Dragon King, won't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me? I shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea, which will be even more wonderful to you-a land-lubber."""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I should love to go,"" said the monkey, ""but how am I to cross the water! I can't swim, as you surely know!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""There is no difficulty about that. I can carry you on my back."""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""That will be troubling you too much,"" said the monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""I can do it quite easily. I am stronger than I look, so you needn't hesitate,"" said the jelly fish, and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Keep very still, Mr. monkey,"" said the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""You mustn't fall into the sea; I am responsible for your safe arrival at the King's Palace."""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Please don't go so fast, or I am sure I shall fall off,"" said the monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Thus they went along, the jelly fish skimming through the waves with the monkey sitting on his back."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"When they were about half-way, the jelly fish, who knew very little of anatomy, began to wonder if the monkey had his liver with him or not!"
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Mr. Monkey, tell me, have you such a thing as a liver with you?"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The monkey was very much surprised at this queer question, and asked what the jelly fish wanted with a liver."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""That is the most important thing of all,"" said the stupid jelly fish, ""so as soon as I recollected it, I asked you if you had yours with you?"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Why is my liver so important to you?"" asked the monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Oh! you will learn the reason later,"" said the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The monkey grew more and more curious and suspicious, and urged the jelly fish to tell him for what his liver was wanted, and ended up by appealing to his hearer's feelings by saying that he was very troubled at what he had been told."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Then the jelly fish, seeing how anxious the monkey looked, was sorry for him, and told him everything."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"How the Dragon Queen had fallen ill, and how the doctor had said that only the liver of a live monkey would cure her, and how the Dragon King had sent him to find one."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Now I have done as I was told, and as soon as we arrive at the Palace the doctor will want your liver, so I feel sorry for you!"" said the silly jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The poor monkey was horrified when he learnt all this, and very angry at the trick played upon him."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"But the monkey was a clever animal, and he thought it the wisest plan not to show any sign of the fear he felt, so he tried to calm himself and to think of some way by which he might escape."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""The doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out! Why I shall die!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,thought the monkey.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"At last a bright thought struck him, so he said quite cheerfully to the jelly fish: ""What a pity it was, Mr. Jelly Fish, that you did not speak of this before we left the island!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""If I had told why I wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come,"" answered the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""You are quite mistaken,"" said the monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Monkeys can very well spare a liver or two, especially when it is wanted for the Dragon Queen of the Sea. If I had only guessed of what you were in need. I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. I have several livers. But the greatest pity is, that as you did not speak in time, I have left all my livers hanging on the pine-tree."""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Have you left your liver behind you?"" asked the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Yes,"" said the cunning monkey, ""during the daytime I usually leave my liver hanging up on the branch of a tree, as it is very much in the way when I am climbing about from tree to tree. To-day, listening to your interesting conversation, I quite forgot it, and left it behind when I came off with you. If only you had spoken in time I should have remembered it, and should have brought it along with me!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this, for he believed every word the monkey said."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,The monkey was of no good without a liver.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Well,"" said the monkey, ""that is soon remedied. I am really sorry to think of all your trouble; but if you will only take me back to the place where you found me, I shall soon be able to get my liver."""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The jelly fish did not at all like the idea of going all the way back to the island again; but the monkey assured him that if he would be so kind as to take him back he would get his very best liver, and bring it with him the next time."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Thus persuaded, the jelly fish turned his course towards the Monkey Island once more."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"No sooner had the jelly fish reached the shore than the sly monkey landed, and getting up into the pine-tree where the jelly fish had first seen him, he cut several capers amongst the branches with joy at being safe home again, and then looking down at the jelly fish said: ""So many thanks for all the trouble you have taken! Please present my compliments to the Dragon King on your return!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,The jelly fish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Then he asked the monkey if it wasn't his intention to come with him at once after getting his liver.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,The monkey replied laughingly that he couldn't afford to lose his liver: it was too precious.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""But remember your promise!"" pleaded the jelly fish, now very discouraged."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""That promise was false, and anyhow it is now broken!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,answered the monkey.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Then he began to jeer at the jelly fish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time; that he had no wish to lose his life, which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the Sea King's Palace to the old doctor waiting for him, instead of persuading the jelly fish to return under false pretenses."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"""Of course, I won't GIVE you my liver, but come and get it if you can!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,added the monkey mockingly from the tree.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"There was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and to return to the Dragon King of the Sea and to confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to swim back."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The last thing he heard as he glided away, leaving the island behind him, was the monkey laughing at him."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Meanwhile the Dragon King, the doctor, the chief steward, and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"When they caught sight of him approaching the Palace, they hailed him with delight."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"They began to thank him profusely for all the trouble he had taken in going to Monkey Island, and then they asked him where the monkey was."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,Now the day of reckoning had come for the jelly fish.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,He quaked all over as he told his story.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"How he had brought the monkey halfway over the sea, and then had stupidly let out the secret of his commission; how the monkey had deceived him by making him believe that he had left his liver behind him."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The Dragon King's wrath was great, and he at once gave orders that the jelly fish was to be severely punished."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,The punishment was a horrible one.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"All the bones were to be drawn out from his living body, and he was to be beaten with sticks."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The poor jelly fish, humiliated and horrified beyond all words, cried out for pardon."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,But the Dragon King's order had to be obeyed.
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"The servants of the Palace forthwith each brought out a stick and surrounded the jelly fish, and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat pulp, and then took him out beyond the Palace gates and threw him into the water."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"Here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering, and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,"From this story it is evident that in former times the jelly fish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King's sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them to-day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan."
fox-and-wolf,"At the foot of some high mountains there was, once upon a time, a small village, and a little way off two roads met, one of them going to the east and the other to the west."
fox-and-wolf,"The villagers were quiet, hard-working folk, who toiled in the fields all day, and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church."
fox-and-wolf,"In the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture, and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset."
fox-and-wolf,"One summer night, when a round full moon shone down upon the white road, a great wolf came trotting round the corner."
fox-and-wolf,"'I positively must get a good meal before I go back to my den,' he said to himself; 'it is nearly a week since I have tasted anything but scraps, though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure! Of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains; but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them, and I am not so young as I was! If I could only dine off that fox I saw a fortnight ago, curled up into a delicious hairy ball, I should ask nothing better; I would have eaten her then, but unluckily her husband was lying beside her, and one knows that foxes, great and small, run like the wind. Really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf, and, as the proverb says: 'One wolf does not bite another.' However, let us see what this village can produce. I am as hungry as a schoolmaster.'"
fox-and-wolf,"Now, while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf, the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road."
fox-and-wolf,"'The whole of this day I have listened to those village hens clucking till I could bear it no longer,' murmured she as she bounded along, hardly seeming to touch the ground."
fox-and-wolf,"'When you are fond of fowls and eggs it is the sweetest of all music. As sure as there is a sun in heaven I will have some of them this night, for I have grown so thin that my very bones rattle, and my poor babies are crying for food.'"
fox-and-wolf,"And as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass, where the two roads joined, and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest, and to settle her plans."
fox-and-wolf,At this moment the wolf came up.
fox-and-wolf,"At the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water, but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was."
fox-and-wolf,"The fox's quick ears heard the sound of his paws, though they were soft as velvet, and turning her head she said politely: 'Is that you, neighbour? What a strange place to meet in! I hope you are quite well?'"
fox-and-wolf,"'Quite well as regards my health,' answered the wolf, whose eye glistened greedily, 'at least, as well as one can be when one is very hungry. But what is the matter with you? A fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish!'"
fox-and-wolf,"'I have been ill-very ill,' replied the fox, 'and what you say is quite true. A worm is fat in comparison with me.'"
fox-and-wolf,He is.
fox-and-wolf,"Still, you are good enough for me; for 'to the hungry no bread is hard.'"
fox-and-wolf,"'Oh, you are always joking! I'm sure you are not half as hungry as I!'"
fox-and-wolf,"'That we shall soon see,' cried the wolf, opening his huge mouth and crouching for a spring."
fox-and-wolf,"'What are you doing?' exclaimed the fox, stepping backwards."
fox-and-wolf,"'What am I doing? What I am going to do is to make my supper off you, in less time than a cock takes to crow.'"
fox-and-wolf,"'Well, I suppose you must have your joke,' answered the fox lightly, but never removing her eye from the wolf, who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth: 'I don't want to joke, but to eat!'"
fox-and-wolf,'But surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all!'
fox-and-wolf,"'In this world the cleverest people are always the hungriest,' replied the wolf. ' Ah! how true that is; but-'"
fox-and-wolf,"'I can't stop to listen to your 'buts' and 'yets,' broke in the wolf rudely; 'let us get to the point, and the point is that I want to eat you and not talk to you.'"
fox-and-wolf,"'Have you no pity for a poor mother?' asked the fox, putting her tail to her eyes, but peeping slily out of them all the same."
fox-and-wolf,"'I am dying of hunger,' answered the wolf, doggedly; 'and you know,' he added with a grin, 'that charity begins at home.'"
fox-and-wolf,"'Quite so,' replied the fox; 'it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense. But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request.'"
fox-and-wolf,"'Then be quick and don't waste my time, for I can't wait much longer. What is it you want?' 'You must know,' said the fox, 'that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard. By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water. For many nights I have crept down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children. All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die.'"
fox-and-wolf,'But the cheeses may be all finished by now?'
fox-and-wolf,"'If you were only to see the quantities of them!' laughed the fox. ' And even if they were finished, there would always be ME to eat.' ' Well, I will come. Lead the way, but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host-that is to say, without my legs, which are as long as yours!'"
fox-and-wolf,"All was silent in the village, and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon, which shone bright and clear in the sky."
fox-and-wolf,"The wolf and the fox crept softly along, when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other; a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses, and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs, who began to bark greedily."
fox-and-wolf,"'Is it safe to go on, think you?' asked the wolf in a whisper."
fox-and-wolf,And the fox shook her head.
fox-and-wolf,"'Not while the dogs are barking,' said she; 'someone might come out to see if anything was the matter.'"
fox-and-wolf,And she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her.
fox-and-wolf,"In about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking, or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them."
fox-and-wolf,"Then the wolf and the fox jumped up, and hastened to the foot of the wall."
fox-and-wolf,"'I am lighter than he is,' thought the fox to herself, 'and perhaps if I make haste I can get a start, and jump over the wall on the other side before he manages to spring over this one.'"
fox-and-wolf,And she quickened her pace.
fox-and-wolf,"But if the wolf could not run he could jump, and with one bound he was beside his companion."
fox-and-wolf,"'What were you going to do, comrade?'"
fox-and-wolf,"' Oh, nothing,' replied the fox, much vexed at the failure of her plan."
fox-and-wolf,"'I think if I were to take a bit out of your haunch you would jump better,' said the wolf, giving a snap at her as he spoke."
fox-and-wolf,The fox drew back uneasily.
fox-and-wolf,"'Be careful, or I shall scream,' she snarled."
fox-and-wolf,"And the wolf, understanding all that might happen if the fox carried out her threat, gave a signal to his companion to leap on the wall, where he immediately followed her."
fox-and-wolf,Once on the top they crouched down and looked about them.
fox-and-wolf,"Not a creature was to be seen in the courtyard, and in the furthest corner from the house stood the well, with its two buckets suspended from a pole, just as the fox had described it."
fox-and-wolf,"The two thieves dragged themselves noiselessly along the wall till they were opposite the well, and by stretching out her neck as far as it would go the fox was able to make out that there was only very little water in the bottom, but just enough to reflect the moon, big, and round and yellow."
fox-and-wolf,'How lucky!' cried she to the wolf.
fox-and-wolf,'There is a huge cheese about the size of a mill wheel. Look! look! did you ever see anything so beautiful!'
fox-and-wolf,"'Never!' answered the wolf, peering over in his turn, his eyes glistening greedily, for he imagined that the moon's reflection in the water was really a cheese. ' And now, unbeliever, what have you to say?'"
fox-and-wolf,and the fox laughed gently.
fox-and-wolf,"' That you are a woman-I mean a fox-of your word,' replied the wolf."
fox-and-wolf,"' Well, then, go down in that bucket and eat your fill,' said the fox."
fox-and-wolf,"' Oh, is that your game?' asked the wolf, with a grin."
fox-and-wolf,' No! no! The person who goes down in the bucket will be you! And if you don't go down your head will go without you!'
fox-and-wolf,"'Of course I will go down, with the greatest pleasure,' answered the fox, who had expected the wolf's reply."
fox-and-wolf,"' And be sure you don't eat all the cheese, or it will be the worse for you,' continued the wolf."
fox-and-wolf,"But the fox looked up at him with tears in her eyes. ' Farewell, suspicious one!'"
fox-and-wolf,she said sadly.
fox-and-wolf,And climbed into the bucket.
fox-and-wolf,"In an instant she had reached the bottom of the well, and found that the water was not deep enough to cover her legs."
fox-and-wolf,"'Why, it is larger and richer than I thought,' cried she, turning towards the wolf, who was leaning over the wall of the well."
fox-and-wolf,"'Then be quick and bring it up,' commanded the wolf."
fox-and-wolf,"'How can I, when it weighs more than I do?' asked the fox."
fox-and-wolf,"'If it is so heavy bring it in two bits, of course,' said he. ' But I have no knife,' answered the fox."
fox-and-wolf,"'You will have to come down yourself, and we will carry it up between us.'"
fox-and-wolf,'And how am I to come down?' inquired the wolf.
fox-and-wolf,"' Oh, you are really very stupid! Get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head.'"
fox-and-wolf,"The wolf looked up, and saw the bucket hanging there, and with some difficulty he climbed into it."
fox-and-wolf,"As he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk, and the other bucket, in which the fox was seated, came to the surface."
fox-and-wolf,"As soon as he understood what was happening, the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf, but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him."
fox-and-wolf,' But where is the cheese?'
fox-and-wolf,"he asked of the fox, who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile."
fox-and-wolf,"' The cheese?' answered the fox; 'why I am taking it home to my babies, who are too young to get food for themselves.'"
fox-and-wolf,"'Ah, traitor!'"
fox-and-wolf,"cried the wolf, howling with rage."
fox-and-wolf,"But the fox was not there to hear this insult, for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl-house, where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before. ' Perhaps I did treat him rather badly,' she said to herself."
fox-and-wolf,"' But it seems getting cloudy, and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom, and his will go up-at least it may!'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The king had just awakened from his midday sleep, for it was summer, and everyone rose early and rested from twelve to three, as they do in hot countries."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"He had dressed himself in cool white clothes, and was passing through the hall on his way to the council chamber, when a number of young nobles suddenly appeared before him, and one amongst them stepped forward and spoke. ' Sire, this morning we were all playing tennis in the court, the prince and this gentleman with the rest, when there broke out some dispute about the game. The prince lost his temper, and said many insulting things to the other, who was playing against him, till at length the gentleman whom you see there struck him violently in the face, so that the blood ran from his mouth and nose. We were all so horrified at the sight, that we should most likely have killed the man then and there, for daring to lay hands on the prince, had not his grandfather the duke stepped between and commanded us to lay the affair before you.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The king had listened attentively to the story, and when it was ended he said: 'I suppose the prince had no arms with him, or else he would have used them?' ' Yes, sire, he had arms; he always carries a dagger in his belt. But when he saw the blood pouring from his face, he went to a corner of the court and began to cry, which was the strangest thing of all.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"On hearing this the king walked to the window and stood for a few minutes with his back to the room, where the company of young men remained silent."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Then he came back, his face white and stern."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'I tell you,' he said, 'and it is the solemn truth, that I would rather you had told me that the prince was dead, though he is my only son, than know that he would suffer such an injury without attempting to avenge it. As for the gentleman who struck him, he will be brought before my judges, and will plead his own cause, but I hardly think he can escape death, after having assaulted the heir to the crown.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The young man raised his head as if to reply, but the king would not listen, and commanded his guards to put him under arrest, adding, however, that if the prisoner wished to visit any part of the city, he was at liberty to do so properly guarded, and in fifteen days he would be brought to trial before the highest judges in the land."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The young man left the king's presence, surrounded by soldiers, and accompanied by many of his friends, for he was a great favourite."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"By their advice he spent the fourteen days that remained to him going about to seek counsel from wise men of all sorts, as to how he might escape death, but no one could help him, for none could find any excuse for the blow he had given to the prince."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The fourteenth night had come, and in despair the prisoner went out to take his last walk through the city."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"He wandered on hardly knowing where he went, and his face was so white and desperate that none of his companions dared speak to him."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The sad little procession had passed some hours in this manner, when, near the gate of a monastery, an old woman appeared round a corner, and suddenly stood before the young man."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"She was bent almost double, and was so wizened and wrinkled that she looked at least ninety; only her eyes were bright and quick as those of a girl."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'Sir,' she said, 'I know all that has happened to you, and how you are seeking if in any wise you can save your life. But there is none that can answer that question save only I myself, if you will promise to do all I ask.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,At her words the prisoner felt as if a load had all at once been rolled off him.
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"' Oh, save me, and I will do anything!'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,he cried.
the-false-prince-and-the-true,'It is so hard to leave the world and go out into the darkness.'
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'You will not need to do that,' answered the old woman, 'you have only got to marry me, and you will soon be free.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'Marry you?' exclaimed he, 'but--but--I am not yet twenty, and you --why, you must be a hundred at least! Oh, no, it is quite impossible.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"He spoke without thinking, but the flash of anger which darted from her eyes made him feel uncomfortable."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"However, all she said was: 'As you like; since you reject me, let the crows have you,' and hurried away down the street."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Left to himself, the full horror of his coming death rushed upon the young man, and he understood that he had thrown away his sole chance of life."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Well, if he must, he must, he said to himself, and began to run as fast as he could after the old crone, who by this time could scarcely be seen, even in the moonlight."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,Who would have believed a woman past ninety could walk with such speed?
the-false-prince-and-the-true,It seemed more like flying!
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"But at length, breathless and exhausted, he reached her side, and gasped out: 'Madam, pardon me for my hasty words just now; I was wrong, and will thankfully accept the offer you made me.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'Ah, I thought you would come to your senses,' answered she, in rather an odd voice."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'We have no time to lose--follow me at once,' and they went on silently and swiftly till they stopped at the door of a small house in which the priest lived."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Before him the old woman bade the prisoner swear that she should be his wife, and this he did in the presence of witnesses."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Then, begging the priest and the guards to leave them alone for a little, she told the young man what he was to do, when the next morning he was brought before the king and the judges."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The hall was full to overflowing when the prisoner entered it, and all marvelled at the brightness of his face."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The king inquired if he had any excuse to plead for the high treason he had committed by striking the heir to the throne, and, if so, to be quick in setting it forth."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"With a low bow the youth made answer in a clear voice: 'O my lord and gracious king, and you, nobles and wise men of the land, I leave my cause without fear in your hands, knowing that you will listen and judge rightly, and that you will suffer me to speak to the end, before you give judgment.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'For four years, you, O king, had been married to the queen and yet had no children, which grieved you greatly. The queen saw this, and likewise that your love was going from her, and thought night and day of some plan that might put an end to this evil. At length, when you were away fighting in distant countries, she decided what she would do, and adopted in secret the baby of a poor quarryman, sending a messenger to tell you that you had a son. No one suspected the truth except a priest to whom the queen confessed the truth, and in a few weeks she fell ill and died, leaving the baby to be brought up as became a prince. And now, if your highness will permit me, I will speak of myself.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'What you have already told me,' answered the king, 'is so strange that I cannot imagine what more there is to tell, but go on with your story.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'One day, shortly after the death of the queen,' continued the young man, 'your highness was hunting, and outstripped all your attendants while chasing the deer. You were in a part of the country which you did not know, so seeing an orchard all pink and white with apple-blossoms, and a girl tossing a ball in one corner, you went up to her to ask your way. But when she turned to answer you, you were so struck with her beauty that all else fled from your mind. Again and again you rode back to see her, and at length persuaded her to marry you. She only thought you a poor knight, and agreed that as you wished it, the marriage should be kept secret.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'After the ceremony you gave her three rings and a charm with a cross on it, and then put her in a cottage in the forest, thinking to hide the matter securely.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'For some months you visited the cottage every week; but a rebellion broke out in a distant part of the kingdom, and called for your presence. When next you rode up to the cottage, it was empty, and none could inform you whither your bride had gone. That, sire, I can now tell you,' and the young man paused and looked at the king, who coloured deeply."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"' She went back to her father the old duke, once your chamberlain, and the cross on her breast revealed at once who you were. Fierce was his anger when he heard his daughter's tale, and he vowed that he would hide her safely from you, till the day when you would claim her publicly as your queen.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'By and bye I was born, and was brought up by my grandfather in one of his great houses. Here are the rings you gave to my mother, and here is the cross, and these will prove if I am your son or not.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"As he spoke the young man laid the jewels at the feet of the king, and the nobles and the judges pressed round to examine them."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The king alone did not move from his seat, for he had forgotten the hall of justice and all about him, and saw only the apple-orchard, as it was twenty years ago, and the beautiful girl playing at ball."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"A sudden silence round him made him look up, and he found the eyes of the assembly fixed on him."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'It is true; it is he who is my son, and not the other,' he said with an effort, 'and let every man present swear to acknowledge him as king, after my death.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Therefore one by one they all knelt before him and took the oath, and a message was sent to the false prince, forbidding him ever again to appear at court, though a handsome pension was granted him."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"At last the ceremony was over, and the king, signing to his newly found son to follow him, rose and went into another room."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'Tell me how you knew all that,' he said, throwing himself into a carved chair filled with crimson cushions, and the prince told of his meeting with the old woman who had brought him the jewels from his mother, and how he had sworn before a priest to marry her, though he did not want to do it, on account of the difference in their ages, and besides, he would rather receive a bride chosen by the king himself."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"But the king frowned, and answered sharply: 'You swore to marry her if she saved your life, and, come what may, you must fulfil your promise.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Then, striking a silver shield that hung close by, he said to the equerry who appeared immediately: 'Go and seek the priest who lives near the door of the prison, and ask him where you can find the old woman who visited him last night; and when you have found her, bring her to the palace.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"It took some time to discover the whereabouts of the old woman, but at length it was accomplished, and when she arrived at the palace with the equerry, she was received with royal honours, as became the bride of the prince."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The guards looked at each other with astonished eyes, as the wizened creature, bowed with age, passed between their lines; but they were more amazed still at the lightness of her step as she skipped up the steps to the great door before which the king was standing, with the prince at his side."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"If they both felt a shock at the appearance of the aged lady they did not show it, and the king, with a grave bow, took her band, and led her to the chapel, where a bishop was waiting to perform the marriage ceremony."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"For the next few weeks little was seen of the prince, who spent all his days in hunting, and trying to forget the old wife at home."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"As for the princess, no one troubled himself about her, and she passed the days alone in her apartments, for she had absolutely declined the services of the ladies-in-waiting whom the king had appointed for her."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"One night the prince returned after a longer chase than usual, and he was so tired that he went up straight to bed."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Suddenly he was awakened by a strange noise in the room, and suspecting that a robber might have stolen in, he jumped out of bed, and seized his sword, which lay ready to his hand."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Then he perceived that the noise proceeded from the next room, which belonged to the princess, and was lighted by a burning torch."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Creeping softly to the door, he peeped through it, and beheld her lying quietly, with a crown of gold and pearls upon her head, her wrinkles all gone, and her face, which was whiter than the snow, as fresh as that of a girl of fourteen."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"Could that really be his wife--that beautiful, beautiful creature?"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"The prince was still gazing in surprise when the lady opened her eyes and smiled at him. ' Yes, I really am your wife,' she said, as if she had guessed his thoughts, 'and the enchantment is ended. Now I must tell you who I am, and what befell to cause me to take the shape of an old woman.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'The king of Granada is my father, and I was born in the palace which overlooks the plain of the Vega. I was only a few months old when a wicked fairy, who had a spite against my parents, cast a spell over me, bending my back and wrinkling my skin till I looked as if I was a hundred years old, and making me such an object of disgust to everyone, that at length the king ordered my nurse to take my away from the palace. She was the only person who cared about me, and we lived together in this city on a small pension allowed me by the king.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'When I was about three an old man arrived at our house, and begged my nurse to let him come in and rest, as he could walk no longer. She saw that he was very ill, so put him to bed and took such care of him that by and bye he was as strong as ever. In gratitude for her goodness to him, he told her that he was a wizard and could give her anything she chose to ask for, except life or death, so she answered that what she longed for most in the world was that my wrinkled skin should disappear, and that I should regain the beauty with which I was born. To this he replied that as my misfortune resulted from a spell, this was rather difficult, but he would do his best, and at any rate he could promise that before my fifteenth birthday I should be freed from the enchantment if I could get a man who would swear to marry me as I was.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'As you may suppose, this was not easy, as my ugliness was such that no one would look at me a second time. My nurse and I were almost in despair, as my fifteenth birthday was drawing near, and I had never so much as spoken to a man. At last we received a visit from the wizard, who told us what had happened at court, and your story, bidding me to put myself in your way when you had lost all hope, and offer to save you if you would consent to marry me.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,"'That is my history, and now you must beg the king to send messengers at once to Granada, to inform my father of our marriage, and I think,' she added with a smile, 'that he will not refuse us his blessing.'"
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"At the time when the Tang dynasty reigned over the Middle Kingdom, there were master swordsmen of various kinds."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,Those who came first were the saints of the sword.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"They were able to take different shapes at will, and their swords were like strokes of lightning."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,Before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,The second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"It was their custom to slay the unjust, and to come to the aid of the oppressed."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,They wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,By magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"They could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls, and they came and went and left no trace."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,The swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,They hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,And death was an everyday matter to them.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,Old Dragonbeard must have been a master swordsman standing midway between those of the first and of the second order.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Molo, however, of whom this story tells, was a sword hero."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"At that time there lived a young man named Tsui, whose father was a high official and the friend of the prince."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"And the father once sent his son to visit his princely friend, who was ill."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"The son was young, handsome and gifted."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,He went to carry out his father's instructions.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"When he entered the prince's palace, there stood three beautiful slave girls, who piled rosy peaches into a golden bowl, poured sugar over them and presented them to him."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"After he had eaten he took his leave, and his princely host ordered one of the slave girls, Rose-Red by name, to escort him to the gate."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,As they went along the young man kept looking back at her.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,And she smiled at him and made signs with her fingers.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"First she would stretch out three fingers, then she would turn her hand around three times, and finally she would point to a little mirror which she wore on her breast."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"When they parted she whispered to him: ""Do not forget me!"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,When the young man reached home his thoughts were all in confusion.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,And he sat down absent-mindedly like a wooden rooster.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Now it happened that he had an old servant named Molo, who was an extraordinary being."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"""What is the trouble, master,"" said he."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"""Why are you so sad? Do you not want to tell your old slave about it?"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"So the boy told him what had occurred, and also mentioned the signs the girl had made to him in secret."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Said Molo: ""When she stretched out three fingers, it meant that she is quartered in the third court of the palace. When she turned round her hand three times, it meant the sum of three times five fingers, which is fifteen. When she pointed at the little mirror, she meant to say that on the fifteenth, when the moon is round as a mirror, at midnight, you are to go for her."""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Then the young man was roused from his confused thoughts, and was so happy he could hardly control himself."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"But soon he grew sad again and said: ""The prince's palace is shut off as though by an ocean. How would it be possible to win into it?"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"""Nothing easier,"" said Molo."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"""On the fifteenth we will take two pieces of dark silk and wrap ourselves up in them, and thus I will carry you there. Yet there is a wild dog on guard at the slave girl's court, who is strong as a tiger and watchful as a god. No one can pass by him, so he must be killed."""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"When the appointed day had come, the servant said: ""There is no one else in the world who can kill this dog but myself!"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Full of joy the youth gave him meat and wine, and the old man took a chain-hammer and disappeared with it."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"And after no more time had elapsed than it takes to eat a meal he was back again and said: ""The dog is dead, and there is nothing further to hinder us!"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"At midnight they wrapped themselves in dark silk, and the old man carried the youth over the tenfold walls which surrounded the palace."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,They reached the third gateway and the gate stood ajar.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Then they saw the glow of a little lamp, and heard Rose-Red sigh deeply."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,The entire court was silent and deserted.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,The youth raised the curtain and stepped into the room.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Long and searchingly Rose-Red looked at him, then seized his hand."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"""I knew that you were intelligent, and would understand my sign language. But what magic power have you at your disposal, that you were able to get here?"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,The youth told her in detail how Molo had helped him.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"""And where is Molo?"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,she asked.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"""Outside, before the curtain,"" was his answer."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Then she called him in and gave him wine to drink from a jade goblet and said: ""I am of good family and have come here from far away. Force alone has made me a slave in this palace. I long to leave it. For though I have jasper chop-sticks with which to eat, and drink my wine from golden flagons, though silk and satin rustle around me and jewels of every kind are at my disposal, all these are but so many chains and fetters to hold me here. Dear Molo, you are endowed with magic powers. I beg you to save me in my distress! If you do, I will be glad to serve your master as a slave, and will never forget the favor you do me."""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,The youth looked at Molo.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,Molo was quite willing.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,First he asked permission to carry away Rose-Red's gear and jewels in sacks and bags.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,Three times he went away and returned until he had finished.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Then he took his master and Rose-Red upon his back, and flew away with them over the steep walls."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,None of the watchmen of the prince's palace noticed anything out of the way.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,At home the youth hid Rose-Red in a distant room.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"When the prince discovered that one of his slave-girls was missing, and that one of his wild dogs had been killed, he said: ""That must have been some powerful sword hero!"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"And he gave strict orders that the matter should not be mentioned, and that investigations should be made in secret."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Two years passed, and the youth no longer thought of any danger."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Hence, when the flowers began to bloom in the spring, Rose-Red went driving in a small wagon outside the city, near the river."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"And there one of the prince's servants saw her, and informed his master."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"The latter sent for the youth, who, since he could not conceal the matter, told him the whole story exactly as it had happened."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Said the prince: ""The whole blame rests on Rose-Red. I do not reproach you. Yet since she is now your wife I will let the whole matter rest. But Molo will have to suffer for it!"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"So he ordered a hundred armored soldiers, with bows and swords, to surround the house of the youth, and under all circumstances to take Molo captive."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,But Molo drew his dagger and flew up the high wall.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,Thence he looked about him like a hawk.
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"The arrows flew as thick as rain, but not one hit him."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"And in a moment he had disappeared, no one knew where."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,"Yet ten years later one of his former master's servants ran across him in the South, where he was selling medicine."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,And he looked exactly as he had looked ten years before.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Many, many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a tennis-ball growing out of his right cheek."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"This lump was a great disfigurement to the old man, and so annoyed him that for many years he spent all his time and money in trying to get rid of it."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,He tried everything he could think of.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He consulted many doctors far and near, and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,But it was all of no use.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The lump only grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as big as his face, and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever losing it, and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the lump on his face all his life."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"One day the firewood gave out in his kitchen, so, as his wife wanted some at once, the old man took his ax and set out for the woods up among the hills not very far from his home."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"It was a fine day in the early autumn, and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"So the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping wood, and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his wife."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"When the day began to draw to a close, he turned his face homewards."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He looked about for some shelter, but there was not even a charcoal-burner's hut near."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,At last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The hole was near the ground, so he crept in easily, and sat down in hopes that he had only been overtaken by a mountain shower, and that the weather would soon clear."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"But much to the old man's disappointment, instead of clearing the rain fell more and more heavily, and finally a heavy thunderstorm broke over the mountain."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The thunder roared so terrifically, and the heavens seemed to be so ablaze with lightning, that the old man could hardly believe himself to be alive."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,He thought that he must die of fright.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"At last, however, the sky cleared, and the whole country was aglow in the rays of the setting sun."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The old man's spirits revived when he looked out at the beautiful twilight, and he was about to step out from his strange hiding-place in the hollow tree when the sound of what seemed like the approaching steps of several people caught his ear."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He at once thought that his friends had come to look for him, and he was delighted at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"But on looking out from the tree, what was his amazement to see, not his friends, but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The more he looked, the greater was his astonishment."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Some of these demons were as large as giants, others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the rest of their bodies, others again had absurdly long noses, and some had such big mouths that they seemed to open from ear to ear."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,All had horns growing on their foreheads.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The old man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Fortunately for him the demons did not see him, as the tree was in the background."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"While he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be able to get home, he heard the sounds of gay music, and then some of the demons began to sing."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""What are these creatures doing?"" said the old man to himself."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""I will look out, it sounds very amusing."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"On peeping out, the old man saw that the demon chief himself was actually sitting with his back against the tree in which he had taken refuge, and all the other demons were sitting round, some drinking and some dancing."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Food and wine was spread before them on the ground, and the demons were evidently having a great entertainment and enjoying themselves immensely."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""How amusing this is!"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"laughed the old man to himself ""I am now quite old, but I have never seen anything so strange in all my life."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He was so interested and excited in watching all that the demons were doing, that he forgot himself and stepped out of the tree and stood looking on."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The demon chief was just taking a big cup of SAKE and watching one of the demons dancing.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"In a little while he said with a bored air: ""Your dance is rather monotonous. I am tired of watching it. Isn't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow?"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Now the old man had been fond of dancing all his life, and was quite an expert in the art, and he knew that he could do much better than the demon."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do? It may be dangerous, for if I don't please them they may kill me!"" said the old fellow to himself."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"His fears, however, were soon overcome by his love of dancing."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"In a few minutes he could restrain himself no longer, and came out before the whole party of demons and began to dance at once."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The old man, realizing that his life probably depended on whether he pleased these strange creatures or not, exerted his skill and wit to the utmost."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The demons were at first very surprised to see a man so fearlessly taking part in their entertainment, and then their surprise soon gave place to admiration."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""How strange!"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,exclaimed the horned chief.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""I never saw such a skillful dancer before! He dances admirably!"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"When the old man had finished his dance, the big demon said: ""Thank you very much for your amusing dance. Now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of wine with us,"" and with these words he handed him his largest wine-cup."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The old man thanked him very humbly: ""I did not expect such kindness from your lordship. I fear I have only disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""No, no,"" answered the big demon."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""You must come often and dance for us. Your skill has given us much pleasure."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The old man thanked him again and promised to do so.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Then will you come again to-morrow, old man?"" asked the demon."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Certainly, I will,"" answered the old man."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us,"" said the demon."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Whatever you like,"" said the old man."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge?"" asked the demon, looking round."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Then said one of the demon's attendants kneeling behind the chief: ""The token he leaves with us must be the most important thing to him in his possession. I see the old man has a wen on his right cheek. Now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate. Let my lord take the lump from the old man's right cheek, and he will surely come to-morrow, if only to get that back."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""You are very clever,"" said the demon chief, giving his horns an approving nod."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Then he stretched out a hairy arm and claw-like hand, and took the great lump from the old man's right cheek."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Strange to say, it came off as easily as a ripe plum from the tree at the demon's touch, and then the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,He hardly knew for some time where he was.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"When he came to understand what had happened to him, he was delighted to find that the lump on his face, which had for so many years disfigured him, had really been taken away without any pain to himself."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He put up his hand to feel if any scar remained, but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The sun had long set, and the young moon had risen like a silver crescent in the sky."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The old man suddenly realized how late it was and began to hurry home.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He patted his right cheek all the time, as if to make sure of his good fortune in having lost the wen."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,He was so happy that he found it impossible to walk quietly--he ran and danced the whole way home.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He found his wife very anxious, wondering what had happened to make him so late."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,He soon told her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"She was quite as happy as her husband when he showed her that the ugly lump had disappeared from his face, for in her youth she had prided herself on his good looks, and it had been a daily grief to her to see the horrid growth."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,Now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He, too, had for many years been troubled with the growth of a wen on his left cheek, and he, too, had tried all manner of things to get rid of it, but in vain."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He heard at once, through the servant, of his neighbor's good luck in losing the lump on his face, so he called that very evening and asked his friend to tell him everything that concerned the loss of it."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He described the place where he would find the hollow tree in which to hide, and advised him to be on the spot in the late afternoon towards the time of sunset."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The old neighbor started out the very next afternoon, and after hunting about for some time, came to the hollow tree just as his friend had described."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,Here he hid himself and waited for the twilight.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Just as he had been told, the band of demons came at that hour and held a feast with dance and song."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"When this had gone on for some time the chief of the demons looked around and said: ""It is now time for the old man to come as he promised us. Why doesn't he come?"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"When the second old man heard these words he ran out of his hiding-place in the tree and, kneeling down before the Oni, said: ""I have been waiting for a long time for you to speak!"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Ah, you are the old man of yesterday,"" said the demon chief."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"""Thank you for coming, you must dance for us soon."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,The old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"But he had never learned to dance, and knew nothing about the necessary gestures and different positions."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He thought that anything would please the demons, so he just hopped about, waving his arms and stamping his feet, imitating as well as he could any dancing he had ever seen."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The Oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition, and said amongst themselves: ""How badly he dances to-day!"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"Then to the old man the demon chief said: ""Your performance to-day is quite different from the dance of yesterday. We don't wish to see any more of such dancing. We will give you back the pledge you left with us. You must go away at once."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"With these words he took out from a fold of his dress the lump which he had taken from the face of the old man who had danced so well the day before, and threw it at the right cheek of the old man who stood before him."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The lump immediately attached itself to his cheek as firmly as if it had grown there always, and all attempts to pull it off were useless."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The wicked old man, instead of losing the lump on his left cheek as he had hoped, found to his dismay that he had but added another to his right cheek in his attempt to get rid of the first."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,He put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare.
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"No, sure enough there was now a great wen on the right side of his face as on the left."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"The demons had all disappeared, and there was nothing for him to do but to return home."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,"He was a pitiful sight, for his face, with the two large lumps, one on each side, looked just like a Japanese gourd."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"There were formerly a king and a queen, who were so sorry that they had no children; so sorry that it cannot be expressed."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"They went to all the waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to no purpose."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"At last, however, the Queen had a daughter."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"There was a very fine christening; and the Princess had for her god-mothers all the fairies they could find in the whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one of them might give her a gift, as was the custom of fairies in those days."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,By this means the Princess had all the perfections imaginable.
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"After the ceremonies of the christening were over, all the company returned to the King's palace, where was prepared a great feast for the fairies."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife, and fork, all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"But as they were all sitting down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven fairies."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some threats between her teeth."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"One of the young fairies who sat by her overheard how she grumbled; and, judging that she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and hid herself behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair, as much as she could, the evil which the old Fairy might intend."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the Princess.
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The youngest gave her for gift that she should be the most beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit of an angel; the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in everything she did; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well; the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that she should play all kinds of music to the utmost perfection."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The old Fairy's turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite than age, she said that the Princess should have her hand pierced with a spindle and die of the wound."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"This terrible gift made the whole company tremble, and everybody fell a-crying."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings, and spake these words aloud: ""Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die of this disaster. It is true, I have no power to undo entirely what my elder has done. The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of which a king's son shall come and awake her."""
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused immediately proclamation to be made, whereby everybody was forbidden, on pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have so much as any spindle in their houses."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"About fifteen or sixteen years after, the King and Queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure, the young Princess happened one day to divert herself in running up and down the palace; when going up from one apartment to another, she came into a little room on the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with her spindle."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,This good woman had never heard of the King's proclamation against spindles.
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"""What are you doing there, goody?"" said the Princess."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"""I am spinning, my pretty child,"" said the old woman, who did not know who she was."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"""Ha!"" said the Princess, ""this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give it to me, that I may see if I can do so."""
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"She had no sooner taken it into her hand than, whether being very hasty at it, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree of the Fairy had so ordained it, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The good old woman, not knowing very well what to do in this affair, cried out for help."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"People came in from every quarter in great numbers; they threw water upon the Princess's face, unlaced her, struck her on the palms of her hands, and rubbed her temples with Hungary-water; but nothing would bring her to herself."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"And now the King, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of the prediction of the fairies, and, judging very well that this must necessarily come to pass, since the fairies had said it, caused the Princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"One would have taken her for a little angel, she was so very beautiful; for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion; her cheeks were carnation, and her lips were coral; indeed, her eyes were shut, but she was heard to breathe softly, which satisfied those about her that she was not dead."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The King commanded that they should not disturb her, but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awaking was come."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The good Fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues off, when this accident befell the Princess; but she was instantly informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one stride."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour after, in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The King handed her out of the chariot, and she approved everything he had done, but as she had very great foresight, she thought when the Princess should awake she might not know what to do with herself, being all alone in this old palace; and this was what she did: she touched with her wand everything in the palace (except the King and Queen)-governesses, maids of honor, ladies of the bedchamber, gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, scullions, guards, with their beefeaters, pages, footmen; she likewise touched all the horses which were in the stables, pads as well as others, the great dogs in the outward court and pretty little Mopsey too, the Princess's little spaniel, which lay by her on the bed."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"Immediately upon her touching them they all fell asleep, that they might not awake before their mistress and that they might be ready to wait upon her when she wanted them."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The very spits at the fire, as full as they could hold of partridges and pheasants, did fall asleep also."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,All this was done in a moment.
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,Fairies are not long in doing their business.
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"And now the King and the Queen, having kissed their dear child without waking her, went out of the palace and put forth a proclamation that nobody should dare to come near it."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"This, however, was not necessary, for in a quarter of an hour's time there grew up all round about the park such a vast number of trees, great and small, bushes and brambles, twining one within another, that neither man nor beast could pass through; so that nothing could be seen but the very top of the towers of the palace; and that, too, not unless it was a good way off."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"Nobody; doubted but the Fairy gave herein a very extraordinary sample of her art, that the Princess, while she continued sleeping, might have nothing to fear from any curious people."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"When a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the King then reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping Princess, being gone a-hunting on that side of the country, asked: What those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood?"
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,Everyone answered according as they had heard.
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"Some said: That it was a ruinous old castle, haunted by spirits."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"Others, That all the sorcerers and witches of the country kept there their sabbath or night's meeting."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The common opinion was: That an ogre lived there, and that he carried thither all the little children he could catch, that he might eat them up at his leisure, without anybody being able to follow him, as having himself only the power to pass through the wood."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The Prince was at a stand, not knowing what to believe, when a very good countryman spake to him thus: ""May it please your royal highness, it is now about fifty years since I heard from my father, who heard my grandfather say, that there was then in this castle a princess, the most beautiful was ever seen; that she must sleep there a hundred years, and should be waked by a king's son, for whom she was reserved."""
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The young Prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without weighing the matter, that he could put an end to this rare adventure; and, pushed on by love and honor, resolved that moment to look into it."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"Scarce had he advanced toward the wood when all the great trees, the bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through; he walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which he went into; and what a little surprised him was that he saw none of his people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as he had passed through them."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"However, he did not cease from continuing his way; a young and amorous prince is always valiant."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"He came into a spacious outward court, where everything he saw might have frozen the most fearless person with horror."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"There reigned all over a most frightful silence; the image of death everywhere showed itself, and there was nothing to be seen but stretched-out bodies of men and animals, all seeming to be dead."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"He, however, very well knew, by the ruby faces and pimpled noses of the beefeaters, that they were only asleep; and their goblets, wherein still remained some drops of wine, showed plainly that they fell asleep in their cups."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs and came into the guard chamber, where guards were standing in their ranks, with their muskets upon their shoulders, and snoring as loud as they could."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"After that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies, all asleep, some standing, others sitting."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"At last he came into a chamber all gilded with gold, where he saw upon a bed, the curtains of which were all open, the finest sight was ever beheld-a princess, who appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and whose bright and, in a manner, resplendent beauty, had somewhat in it divine."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"He approached with trembling and admiration, and fell down before her upon his knees."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"And now, as the enchantment was at an end, the Princess awaked, and looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to admit of: ""Is it you, my Prince?"" said she to him."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"""You have waited a long while."""
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The Prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude; he assured her that he loved her better than he did himself; their discourse was not well connected, they did weep more than talk-little eloquence, a great deal of love."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"He was more at a loss than she, and we need not wonder at it; she had time to think on what to say to him; for it is very probable (though history mentions nothing of it) that the good Fairy, during so long a sleep, had given her very agreeable dreams."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"In short, they talked four hours together, and yet they said not half what they had to say."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"In the meanwhile all the palace awaked; everyone thought upon their particular business, and as all of them were not in love they were ready to die for hunger."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The chief lady of honor, being as sharp set as other folks, grew very impatient, and told the Princess aloud that supper was served up."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The Prince helped the Princess to rise; she was entirely dressed, and very magnificently, but his royal highness took care not to tell her that she was dressed like his great-grandmother, and had a point band peeping over a high collar; she looked not a bit less charming and beautiful for all that."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and were served by the Princess's officers, the violins and hautboys played old tunes, but very excellent, though it was now above a hundred years since they had played; and after supper, without losing any time, the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief lady of honor drew the curtains."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"They had but very little sleep-the Princess had no occasion; and the Prince left her next morning to return to the city, where his father must needs have been in pain for him."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The Prince told him: That he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting, and that he had lain in the cottage of a charcoal-burner, who gave him cheese and brown bread."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The King, his father, who was a good man, believed him; but his mother could not be persuaded it was true; and seeing that he went almost every day a-hunting, and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing, though he had lain out three or four nights together, she began to suspect that he was married, for he lived with the Princess above two whole years, and had by her two children, the eldest of which, who was a daughter, was named Morning, and the youngest, who was a son, they called Day, because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful than his sister."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"The Queen spoke several times to her son, to inform herself after what manner he did pass his time, and that in this he ought in duty to satisfy her."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"But he never dared to trust her with his secret; he feared her, though he loved her, for she was of the race of the Ogres, and the King would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches; it was even whispered about the Court that she had Ogreish inclinations, and that, whenever she saw little children passing by, she had all the difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,And so the Prince would never tell her one word.
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"But when the King was dead, which happened about two years afterward, and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage; and he went in great ceremony to conduct his Queen to the palace."
sleeping-beauty-in-the-wood,"They made a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two children."
golden-goose,THERE was once a man who had three sons.
golden-goose,"The youngest of them was called Dullhead, and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity."
golden-goose,"One day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood, and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine, so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst."
golden-goose,"When he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him 'Good-morning,' and said: 'Do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine-I am so hungry and thirsty.'"
golden-goose,But this clever son replied: 'If I give you my cake and wine I shall have none left for myself; you just go your own way;' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest.
golden-goose,"There he began to cut down a tree, but before long he made a false stroke with his axe, and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up."
golden-goose,"Then the second son went to the forest, and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother."
golden-goose,"He too met the little old grey man, who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine."
golden-goose,"But the second son spoke most sensibly too, and said: 'Whatever I give to you I deprive myself of. Just go your own way, will you?'"
golden-goose,"Not long after his punishment overtook him, for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe, than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home."
golden-goose,"So then Dullhead said: 'Father, let me go out and cut wood.'"
golden-goose,But his father answered: 'Both your brothers have injured themselves. You had better leave it alone; you know nothing about it.'
golden-goose,"But Dullhead begged so hard to be allowed to go that at last his father said: 'Very well, then-go. Perhaps when you have hurt yourself, you may learn to know better.'"
golden-goose,"His mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and a bottle of sour beer."
golden-goose,"When he got to the forest, he too met the little grey old man, who greeted him and said: 'Give me a piece of your cake and a draught from your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.'"
golden-goose,"And Dullhead replied: 'I've only got a cinder-cake and some sour beer, but if you care to have that, let us sit down and eat.'"
golden-goose,"So they sat down, and when Dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake, and the sour beer into excellent wine."
golden-goose,"Then they ate and drank, and when they had finished the little man said: 'Now I will bring you luck, because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others. There stands an old tree; cut it down, and amongst its roots you'll find something.'"
golden-goose,With that the little man took leave.
golden-goose,"Then Dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree, and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose, whose feathers were all of pure gold."
golden-goose,"He lifted it out, carried it off, and took it with him to an inn where he meant to spend the night."
golden-goose,"Now the landlord of the inn had three daughters, and when they saw the goose they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be, and each longed to have one of its golden feathers."
golden-goose,"The eldest thought to herself: 'No doubt I shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers,' and the first time Dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing."
golden-goose,"But, lo and behold!"
golden-goose,"her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose, and she could not take her hand away."
golden-goose,"Soon after the second daughter came in, and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too; but hardly had she touched her sister than she stuck fast as well."
golden-goose,"At last the third sister came with the same intentions, but the other two cried out: 'Keep off! for Heaven's sake, keep off!'"
golden-goose,"The younger sister could not imagine why she was to keep off, and thought to herself: 'If they are both there, why should not I be there too?'"
golden-goose,So she sprang to them; but no sooner had she touched one of them than she stuck fast to her.
golden-goose,So they all three had to spend the night with the goose.
golden-goose,"Next morning Dullhead tucked the goose under his arm and went off, without in the least troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it."
golden-goose,They just had to run after him right or left as best they could.
golden-goose,"In the middle of a field they met the parson, and when he saw this procession he cried: 'For shame, you bold girls! What do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that? Do you call that proper behaviour?'"
golden-goose,And with that he caught the youngest girl by the hand to try and draw her away.
golden-goose,"But directly he touched her he hung on himself, and had to run along with the rest of them."
golden-goose,"Not long after the clerk came that way, and was much surprised to see the parson following the footsteps of three girls."
golden-goose,"'Why, where is your reverence going so fast?' cried he; 'don't forget there is to be a christening to-day;' and he ran after him, caught him by the sleeve, and hung on to it himself: As the five of them trotted along in this fashion one after the other, two peasants were coming from their work with their hoes."
golden-goose,On seeing them the parson called out and begged them to come and rescue him and the clerk.
golden-goose,"But no sooner did they touch the clerk than they stuck on too, and so there were seven of them running after Dullhead and his goose."
golden-goose,After a time they all came to a town where a King reigned whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever manage to make her laugh.
golden-goose,So the King had decreed that whoever should succeed in making her laugh should marry her.
golden-goose,"When Dullhead heard this he marched before the Princess with his goose and its appendages, and as soon as she saw these seven people continually running after each other she burst out laughing, and could not stop herself."
golden-goose,"Then Dullhead claimed her as his bride, but the King, who did not much fancy him as a son-in-law, made all sorts of objections, and told him he must first find a man who could drink up a whole cellarful of wine."
golden-goose,"Dullhead bethought him of the little grey man, who could, he felt sure, help him; so he went off to the forest, and on the very spot where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting with a most dismal expression of face."
golden-goose,"Dullhead asked him what he was taking so much to heart, and the man answered: 'I don't know how I am ever to quench this terrible thirst I am suffering from. Cold water doesn't suit me at all. To be sure I've emptied a whole barrel of wine, but what is one drop on a hot stone?'"
golden-goose,"'I think I can help you,' said Dullhead."
golden-goose,"'Come with me, and you shall drink to your heart's content.'"
golden-goose,"So he took him to the King's cellar, and the man sat down before the huge casks and drank and drank till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar before the day closed."
golden-goose,"Then Dullhead asked once more for his bride, but the King felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called 'Dullhead' carrying off his daughter, and he began to make fresh conditions."
golden-goose,He required Dullhead to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread.
golden-goose,"Dullhead did not wait to consider long but went straight off to the forest, and there on the same spot sat a man who was drawing in a strap as tight as he could round his body, and making a most woeful face the while."
golden-goose,"Said he: 'I've eaten up a whole oven full of loaves, but what's the good of that to anyone who is as hungry as I am? I declare my stomach feels quite empty, and I must draw my belt tight if I'm not to die of starvation.'"
golden-goose,"Dullhead was delighted, and said: 'Get up and come with me, and you shall have plenty to eat,' and he brought him to the King's Court."
golden-goose,"Now the King had given orders to have all the flour in his kingdom brought together, and to have a huge mountain baked of it."
golden-goose,"But the man from the wood just took up his stand before the mountain and began to eat, and in one day it had all vanished."
golden-goose,"For the third time Dullhead asked for his bride, but again the King tried to make some evasion, and demanded a ship 'which could sail on land or water! When you come sailing in such a ship,' said he, 'you shall have my daughter without further delay.'"
golden-goose,"Again Dullhead started off to the forest, and there he found the little old grey man with whom he had shared his cake, and who said: 'I have eaten and I have drunk for you, and now I will give you the ship. I have done all this for you because you were kind and merciful to me.'"
golden-goose,"Then he gave Dullhead a ship which could sail on land or water, and when the King saw it he felt he could no longer refuse him his daughter."
golden-goose,"So they celebrated the wedding with great rejoicings; and after the King's death Dullhead succeeded to the kingdom, and lived happily with his wife for many years after."
the-dwarfie-stone,Far up in a green valley in the Island of Hoy stands an immense boulder.
the-dwarfie-stone,"It is hollow inside, and the natives of these northern islands call it the Dwarfie Stone, because long centuries ago, so the legend has it, Snorro the Dwarf lived there."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Nobody knew where Snorro came from, or how long he had dwelt in the dark chamber inside the Dwarfie Stone."
the-dwarfie-stone,"All that they knew about him was that he was a little man, with a queer, twisted, deformed body and a face of marvellous beauty, which never seemed to look any older, but was always smiling and young."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Men said that this was because Snorro's father had been a Fairy, and not a denizen of earth, who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetual youth, but nobody knew whether this were true or not, for the Dwarf had inhabited the Dwarfie Stone long before the oldest man or woman in Hoy had been born."
the-dwarfie-stone,"One thing was certain, however: he had inherited from his mother, whom all men agreed had been mortal, the dangerous qualities of vanity and ambition."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And the longer he lived the more vain and ambitious did he become, until at last he always carried a mirror of polished steel round his neck, into which he constantly looked in order to see the reflection of his handsome face."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And he would not attend to the country people who came to seek his help, unless they bowed themselves humbly before him and spoke to him as if he were a King."
the-dwarfie-stone,"I say that the country people sought his help, for he spent his time, or appeared to spend it, in collecting herbs and simples on the hillsides, which he carried home with him to his dark abode, and distilled medicines and potions from them, which he sold to his neighbours at wondrous high prices."
the-dwarfie-stone,"He was also the possessor of a wonderful leathern-covered book, clasped with clasps of brass, over which he would pore for hours together, and out of which he would tell the simple Islanders their fortunes, if they would."
the-dwarfie-stone,"For they feared the book almost as much as they feared Snorro himself, for it was whispered that it had once belonged to Odin, and they crossed themselves for protection as they named the mighty Enchanter."
the-dwarfie-stone,But all the time they never guessed the real reason why Snorro chose to live in the Dwarfie Stone.
the-dwarfie-stone,I will tell you why he did so.
the-dwarfie-stone,"Not very far from the Stone there was a curious hill, shaped exactly like a wart."
the-dwarfie-stone,"It was known as the Wart Hill of Hoy, and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden a wonderful carbuncle, which, when it was found, would bestow on its finder marvellous magic gifts--Health, Wealth, and Happiness."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Everything, in fact, that a human being could desire."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And the curious thing about this carbuncle was, that it was said that it could be seen at certain times, if only the people who were looking for it were at the right spot at the right moment."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Now Snorro had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone, so, while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great book or distilling medicines from his herbs, he was really keeping a keen look-out during his wanderings, noting every tuft of grass or piece of rock under which it might be hidden."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And at night, when everyone else was asleep, he would creep out, with pickaxe and spade, to turn over the rocks or dig over the turf, in the hope of finding the long-sought-for treasure underneath them."
the-dwarfie-stone,"He was always accompanied on these occasions by an enormous grey-headed Raven, who lived in the cave along with him, and who was his bosom friend and companion."
the-dwarfie-stone,"The Islanders feared this bird of ill omen as much, perhaps, as they feared its Master; for, although they went to consult Snorro in all their difficulties and perplexities, and bought medicines and love-potions from him, they always looked upon him with a certain dread, feeling that there was something weird and uncanny about him."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Now, at the time we are speaking of, Orkney was governed by two Earls, who were half-brothers."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Paul, the elder, was a tall, handsome man, with dark hair, and eyes like sloes."
the-dwarfie-stone,"All the country people loved him, for he was so skilled in knightly exercises, and had such a sweet and loving nature, that no one could help being fond of him."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Old people's eyes would brighten at the sight of him, and the little children would run out to greet him as he rode by their mothers' doors."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And this was the more remarkable because, with all his winning manner, he had such a lack of conversation that men called him Paul the Silent, or Paul the Taciturn."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Harold, on the other hand, was as different from his brother as night is from day."
the-dwarfie-stone,"He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, and he had gained for himself the name of Harold the Orator, because he was always free of speech and ready with his tongue."
the-dwarfie-stone,But for all this he was not a favourite.
the-dwarfie-stone,"For he was haughty, and jealous, and quick-tempered, and the old folks' eyes did not brighten at the sight of him, and the babes, instead of toddling out to greet him, hid their faces in their mothers' skirts when they saw him coming."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Harold could not help knowing that the people liked his silent brother best, and the knowledge made him jealous of him, so a coldness sprang up between them."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Now it chanced, one summer, that Earl Harold went on a visit to the King of Scotland, accompanied by his mother, the Countess Helga, and her sister, the Countess Fraukirk."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And while he was at Court he met a charming young Irish lady, the Lady Morna, who had come from Ireland to Scotland to attend upon the Scottish Queen."
the-dwarfie-stone,"She was so sweet, and good, and gentle that Earl Harold's heart was won, and he made up his mind that she, and only she, should be his bride."
the-dwarfie-stone,"But although he had paid her much attention, Lady Morna had sometimes caught glimpses of his jealous temper; she had seen an evil expression in his eyes, and had heard him speak sharply to his servants, and she had no wish to marry him."
the-dwarfie-stone,"So, to his great amazement, she refused the honour which he offered her, and told him that she would prefer to remain as she was."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Earl Harold ground his teeth in silent rage, but he saw that it was no use pressing his suit at that moment."
the-dwarfie-stone,So what he could not obtain by his own merits he determined to obtain by guile.
the-dwarfie-stone,"Accordingly he begged his mother to persuade the Lady Morna to go back with them on a visit, hoping that when she was alone with him in Orkney, he would be able to overcome her prejudice against him, and induce her to become his wife."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And all the while he never remembered his brother Paul; or, if he did, he never thought it possible that he could be his rival."
the-dwarfie-stone,But that was just the very thing that happened.
the-dwarfie-stone,"The Lady Morna, thinking no evil, accepted the Countess Helga's invitation, and no sooner had the party arrived back in Orkney than Paul, charmed with the grace and beauty of the fair Irish Maiden, fell head over ears in love with her."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And the Lady Morna, from the very first hour that she saw him, returned his love."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Of course this state of things could not long go on hidden, and when Harold realised what had happened his anger and jealousy knew no bounds."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Seizing a dagger, he rushed up to the turret where his brother was sitting in his private apartments, and threatened to stab him to the heart if he did not promise to give up all thoughts of winning the lovely stranger."
the-dwarfie-stone,But Paul met him with pleasant words.
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Calm thyself, Brother,"" he said."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""It is true that I love the lady, but that is no proof that I shall win her. Is it likely that she will choose me, whom all men name Paul the Silent, when she hath the chance of marrying you, whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the proud title of Harold the Orator?"""
the-dwarfie-stone,"At these words Harold's vanity was flattered, and he thought that, after all, his step-brother was right, and that he had a very small chance, with his meagre gift of speech, of being successful in his suit."
the-dwarfie-stone,"So he threw down his dagger, and, shaking hands with him, begged him to pardon his unkind thoughts, and went down the winding stair again in high good-humour with himself and all the world."
the-dwarfie-stone,"By this time it was coming near to the Feast of Yule, and at that Festival it was the custom for the Earl and his Court to leave Kirkwall for some weeks, and go to the great Palace of Orphir, nine miles distant."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And in order to see that everything was ready, Earl Paul took his departure some days before the others."
the-dwarfie-stone,The evening before he left he chanced to find the Lady Morna sitting alone in one of the deep windows of the great hall.
the-dwarfie-stone,"She had been weeping, for she was full of sadness at the thought of his departure; and at the sight of her distress the kind-hearted young Earl could no longer contain himself, but, folding her in his arms, he whispered to her how much he loved her, and begged her to promise to be his wife."
the-dwarfie-stone,She agreed willingly.
the-dwarfie-stone,"Hiding her rosy face on his shoulder, she confessed that she had loved him from the very first day that she had seen him; and ever since that moment she had determined that, if she could not wed him, she would wed no other man."
the-dwarfie-stone,"For a little time they sat together, rejoicing in their new-found happiness."
the-dwarfie-stone,Then Earl Paul sprang to his feet.
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Let us go and tell the good news to my mother and my brother,"" he said."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Harold may be disappointed at first, for I know, Sweetheart, he would fain have had thee for his own. But his good heart will soon overcome all that, and he will rejoice with us also."""
the-dwarfie-stone,But the Lady Morna shook her head.
the-dwarfie-stone,"She knew, better than her lover, what Earl Harold's feeling would be; and she would fain put off the evil hour."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Let us hold our peace till after Yule,"" she pleaded."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""It will be a joy to keep our secret to ourselves for a little space; there will be time enough then to let all the world know."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"Rather reluctantly, Earl Paul agreed; and next day he set off for the Palace at Orphir, leaving his lady-love behind him."
the-dwarfie-stone,Little he guessed the danger he was in!
the-dwarfie-stone,"For, all unknown to him, his step-aunt, Countess Fraukirk, had chanced to be in the hall, the evening before, hidden behind a curtain, and she had overheard every word that Morna"
the-dwarfie-stone,"and he had spoken, and her heart was filled with black rage."
the-dwarfie-stone,"For she was a hard, ambitious woman, and she had always hated the young Earl, who was no blood-relation to her, and who stood in the way of his brother, her own nephew; for, if Paul were only dead, Harold would be the sole Earl of Orkney."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And now that he had stolen the heart of the Lady Morna, whom her own nephew loved, her hate and anger knew no bounds."
the-dwarfie-stone,She had hastened off to her sister's chamber as soon as the lovers had parted; and there the two women had remained talking together till the chilly dawn broke in the sky.
the-dwarfie-stone,Countess Fraukirk ... hidden behind a curtain ... overheard every word.]
the-dwarfie-stone,Next day a boat went speeding over the narrow channel of water that separates Pomona (on the mainland) from Hoy.
the-dwarfie-stone,"In it sat a woman, but who she was, or what she was like, no one could say, for she was covered from head to foot with a black cloak, and her face was hidden behind a thick, dark veil."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Snorro the Dwarf knew her, even before she laid aside her trappings, for Countess Fraukirk was no stranger to him."
the-dwarfie-stone,"In the course of her long life she had often had occasion to seek his aid to help her in her evil deeds, and she had always paid him well for his services in yellow gold."
the-dwarfie-stone,"He therefore welcomed her gladly; but when he had heard the nature of her errand his smiling face grew grave again, and he shook his head."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""I have served thee well, Lady, in the past,"" he said, ""but methinks that this thing goeth beyond my courage. For to compass an Earl's death is a weighty matter, especially when he is so well beloved as is the Earl Paul."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Thou knowest why I have taken up my abode in this lonely spot--how I hope some day to light upon the magic carbuncle. Thou knowest also how the people fear me, and hate me too, forsooth. And if the young Earl died, and suspicion fell on me, I must needs fly the Island, for my life would not be worth a grain of sand. Then my chance of success would be gone. Nay! I cannot do it, Lady; I cannot do it."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"But the wily Countess offered him much gold, and bribed him higher and higher, first with wealth, then with success, and lastly she promised to obtain for him a high post at the Court of the King of Scotland; and at that his ambition stirred within him, his determination gave way, and he consented to do what she asked."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""I will summon my magic loom,"" he said, ""and weave a piece of cloth of finest texture and of marvellous beauty; and before I weave it I will so poison the thread with a magic potion that, when it is fashioned into a garment, whoever puts it on will die ere he hath worn it many minutes."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Thou art a clever knave,"" answered the Countess, a cruel smile lighting up her evil face, ""and thou shalt be rewarded. Let me have a couple of yards of this wonderful web, and I will make a bonnie waistcoat for my fine young Earl and give it to him as a Yuletide gift. Then I reckon that he will not see the year out."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"""That will he not,"" said Dwarf Snorro, with a malicious grin; and the two parted, after arranging that the piece of cloth should be delivered at the Palace of Orphir on the day before Christmas Eve."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Now, when the Countess Fraukirk had been away upon her wicked errand, strange things were happening at the Castle at Kirkwall."
the-dwarfie-stone,"For Harold, encouraged by his brother's absence, offered his heart and hand once more to the Lady Morna."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Once more she refused him, and in order to make sure that the scene should not be repeated, she told him that she had plighted her troth to his brother."
the-dwarfie-stone,"When he heard that this was so, rage and fury were like to devour him."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Mad with anger, he rushed from her presence, flung himself upon his horse, and rode away in the direction of the sea shore."
the-dwarfie-stone,"While he was galloping wildly along, his eyes fell on the snow-clad hills of Hoy rising up across the strip of sea that divided the one island from the other."
the-dwarfie-stone,"And his thoughts flew at once to Snorro the Dwarf, who he had had occasion, as well as his step-aunt, to visit in bygone days."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""I have it,"" he cried."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Stupid fool that I was not to think of it at once. I will go to Snorro, and buy from him a love-potion, which will make my Lady Morna hate my precious brother and turn her thoughts kindly towards me."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"So he made haste to hire a boat, and soon he was speeding over the tossing waters on his way to the Island of Hoy."
the-dwarfie-stone,"When he arrived there he hurried up the lonely valley to where the Dwarfie Stone stood, and he had no difficulty in finding its uncanny occupant, for Snorro was standing at the hole that served as a door, his raven on his shoulder, gazing placidly at the setting sun."
the-dwarfie-stone,"A curious smile crossed his face when, hearing the sound of approaching footsteps, he turned round and his eyes fell on the young noble."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""What bringeth thee here, Sir Earl?"" he asked gaily, for he scented more gold."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""I come for a love-potion,"" said Harold; and without more ado he told the whole story to the Wizard."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""I will pay thee for it,"" he added, ""if thou wilt give it to me quickly."""
the-dwarfie-stone,Snorro looked at him from head to foot.
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Blind must the maiden be, Sir Orator,"" he said, ""who needeth a love-potion to make her fancy so gallant a Knight."""
the-dwarfie-stone,Earl Harold laughed angrily.
the-dwarfie-stone,"""It is easier to catch a sunbeam than a woman's roving fancy,"" he replied."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""I have no time for jesting. For, hearken, old man, there is a proverb that saith, 'Time and tide wait for no man,' so I need not expect the tide to wait for me. The potion I must have, and that instantly."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"Snorro saw that he was in earnest, so without a word he entered his dwelling, and in a few minutes returned with a small phial in his hand, which was full of a rosy liquid."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Pour the contents of this into the Lady Morna's wine-cup,"" he said, ""and I warrant thee that before four-and-twenty hours have passed she will love thee better than thou lovest her now."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"Then he waved his hand, as if to dismiss his visitor, and disappeared into his dwelling-place."
the-dwarfie-stone,Earl Harold made all speed back to the Castle; but it was not until one or two days had elapsed that he found a chance to pour the love-potion into the Lady Morna's wine-cup.
the-dwarfie-stone,"But at last, one night at supper, he found an opportunity of doing so, and, waving away the little page-boy, he handed it to her himself."
the-dwarfie-stone,"She raised it to her lips, but she only made a pretence at drinking, for she had seen the hated Earl fingering the cup, and she feared some deed of treachery."
the-dwarfie-stone,"When he had gone back to his seat she managed to pour the whole of the wine on the floor, and smiled to herself at the look of satisfaction that came over Harold's face as she put down the empty cup."
the-dwarfie-stone,"His satisfaction increased, for from that moment she felt so afraid of him that she treated him with great kindness, hoping that by doing so she would keep in his good graces until the Court moved to Orphir, and her own true love could protect her."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Harold, on his side, was delighted with her graciousness, for he felt certain that the charm was beginning to work, and that his hopes would soon be fulfilled."
the-dwarfie-stone,"A week later the Court removed to the Royal Palace at Orphir, where Earl Paul had everything in readiness for the reception of his guests."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Of course he was overjoyed to meet Lady Morna again, and she was overjoyed to meet him, for she felt that she was now safe from the unwelcome attentions of Earl Harold."
the-dwarfie-stone,"But to Earl Harold the sight of their joy was as gall and bitterness, and he could scarcely contain himself, although he still trusted in the efficacy of Snorro the Dwarf's love-potion."
the-dwarfie-stone,"As for Countess Fraukirk and Countess Helga, they looked forward eagerly to the time when the magic web would arrive, out of which they hoped to fashion a fatal gift for Earl Paul."
the-dwarfie-stone,"At last, the day before Christmas Eve, the two wicked women were sitting in the Countess Helga's chamber talking of the time when Earl Harold would rule alone in Orkney, when a tap came to the window, and on looking round they saw Dwarf Snorro's grey-headed Raven perched on the sill, a sealed packet in its beak."
the-dwarfie-stone,"They opened the casement, and with a hoarse croak the creature let the packet drop on to the floor; then it flapped its great wings and rose slowly into the air again its head turned in the direction of Hoy."
the-dwarfie-stone,With fingers that trembled with excitement they broke the seals and undid the packet.
the-dwarfie-stone,"It contained a piece of the most beautiful material that anyone could possibly imagine, woven in all the colours of the rainbow, and sparkling with gold and jewels."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Twill make a bonnie waistcoat,"" exclaimed Countess Fraukirk, with an unholy laugh."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""The Silent Earl will be a braw man when he gets it on."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"Then, without more ado, they set to work to cut out and sew the garment."
the-dwarfie-stone,"All that night they worked, and all next day, till, late in the afternoon, when they were putting in the last stitches, hurried footsteps were heard ascending the winding staircase, and Earl Harold burst open the door."
the-dwarfie-stone,"His cheeks were red with passion, and his eyes were bright, for he could not but notice that, now that she was safe at Orphir under her true love's protection, the Lady Morna's manner had grown cold and distant again, and he was beginning to lose faith in Snorro's charm."
the-dwarfie-stone,"Angry and disappointed, he had sought his mother's room to pour out his story of vexation to her."
the-dwarfie-stone,"He stopped short, however, when he saw the wonderful waistcoat lying on the table, all gold and silver and shining colours."
the-dwarfie-stone,"It was like a fairy garment, and its beauty took his breath away."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""For whom hast thou purchased that?"" he asked, hoping to hear that it was intended for him."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Tis a Christmas gift for thy brother Paul,"" answered his mother, and she would have gone on to tell him how deadly a thing it was, had he given her time to speak."
the-dwarfie-stone,"But her words fanned his fury into madness, for it seemed to him that this hated brother of his was claiming everything."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""Everything is for Paul! I am sick of his very name,"" he cried."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""By my troth, he shall not have this!"""
the-dwarfie-stone,and he snatched the vest from the table.
the-dwarfie-stone,"It was in vain that his mother and his aunt threw themselves at his feet, begging him to lay it down, and warning him that there was not a thread in it which was not poisoned."
the-dwarfie-stone,"He paid no heed to their words, but rushed from the room, and, drawing it on, ran downstairs with a reckless laugh, to show the Lady Morna how fine he was."
the-dwarfie-stone,Alas!
the-dwarfie-stone,alas!
the-dwarfie-stone,Scarce had he gained the hall than he fell to the ground in great pain.
the-dwarfie-stone,"Everyone crowded round him, and the two Countesses, terrified now by what they had done, tried in vain to tear the magic vest from his body."
the-dwarfie-stone,"But he felt that it was too late, the deadly poison had done its work, and, waving them aside, he turned to his brother, who, in great distress, had knelt down and taken him tenderly in his arms."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""I wronged thee, Paul,"" he gasped."
the-dwarfie-stone,"""For thou hast ever been true and kind. Forgive me in thy thoughts, and,"" he added, gathering up his strength for one last effort, and pointing to the two wretched women who had wrought all this misery, ""_Beware of those two women_, for they seek to take thy life."""
the-dwarfie-stone,"Then his head sank back on his brother's shoulder, and, with one long sigh, he died."
the-dwarfie-stone,"When he learned what had happened, and understood where the waistcoat came from, and for what purpose it had been intended, the anger of the Silent Earl knew no bounds."
the-dwarfie-stone,"He swore a great oath that he would be avenged, not only on Snorro the Dwarf, but also on his wicked step-mother and her cruel sister."
the-dwarfie-stone,"His vengeance was baulked, however, for in the panic and confusion that followed Harold's death, the two Countesses slipped out of the Palace and fled to the coast, and took boat in haste to Scotland, where they had great possessions, and where they were much looked up to, and where no one would believe a word against them."
the-dwarfie-stone,"But retribution fell on them in the end, as it always does fall, sooner or later, on everyone who is wicked, or selfish, or cruel; for the Norsemen invaded the land, and their Castle was set on fire, and they perished miserably in the flames."
the-dwarfie-stone,"When Earl Paul found that they had escaped, he set out in hot haste for the Island of Hoy, for he was determined that the Dwarf, at least, should not escape."
the-dwarfie-stone,"But when he came to the Dwarfie Stone he found it silent and deserted, all trace of its uncanny occupants having disappeared."
the-dwarfie-stone,"No one knew what had become of them; a few people were inclined to think that the Dwarf and his Raven had accompanied the Countess Fraukirk and the Countess Helga on their flight, but the greater part of the Islanders held to the belief, which I think was the true one, that the Powers of the Air spirited Snorro away, and shut him up in some unknown place as a punishment for his wickedness, and that his Raven accompanied him."
the-dwarfie-stone,"At any rate, he was never seen again by any living person, and wherever he went, he lost all chance of finding the magic carbuncle."
the-dwarfie-stone,"As for the Silent Earl and his Irish Sweetheart, they were married as soon as Earl Harold's funeral was over; and for hundreds of years afterwards, when the inhabitants of the Orkney Isles wanted to express great happiness, they said, ""As happy as Earl Paul and the Countess Morna."""
hat-of-huldres,"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast."
hat-of-huldres,"As he chanced to cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag."
hat-of-huldres,"He picked it up, for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his wife for a dish-rag."
hat-of-huldres,"But when he came to the house where they were celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him."
hat-of-huldres,"The bride and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink."
hat-of-huldres,"Then the chief cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was not asked, nor did he get anything to eat."
hat-of-huldres,For he did not care to sit down of his own accord when no one had asked him.
hat-of-huldres,"At last he grew angry and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of attention to me here."""
hat-of-huldres,"When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening, here I am back again."""
hat-of-huldres,"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife."
hat-of-huldres,"""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there."""
hat-of-huldres,"""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his wife."
hat-of-huldres,"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a huldre hat."
hat-of-huldres,"""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?"""
hat-of-huldres,asked the man.
hat-of-huldres,"""There is an old hair strainer for you. I found it outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench."
hat-of-huldres,"And then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the huldres disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away."
hat-of-huldres,"Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the wedding-feast."
hat-of-huldres,"And this time he was received in right friendly fashion, and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."
the-wee-bannock,"""Some tell about their sweethearts, How they tirled them to the winnock, But I'll tell you a bonnie tale About a guid oatmeal bannock."""
the-wee-bannock,"There was once an old man and his wife, who lived in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn."
the-wee-bannock,"They were a very canty and contented couple, for they had enough to live on, and enough to do."
the-wee-bannock,"Indeed, they considered themselves quite rich, for, besides their cottage and their garden, they possessed two sleek cows, five hens and a cock, an old cat, and two kittens."
the-wee-bannock,"The old man spent his time looking after the cows, and the hens, and the garden; while the old woman kept herself busy spinning."
the-wee-bannock,"One day, just after breakfast, the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening, so she took down her bakeboard, and put on her girdle, and baked a couple of fine cakes, and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden."
the-wee-bannock,"While they were toasting, her husband came in from the byre, and sat down to take a rest in his great arm-chair."
the-wee-bannock,"Presently his eyes fell on the bannocks, and, as they looked very good, he broke one through the middle and began to eat it."
the-wee-bannock,"When the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate, so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could."
the-wee-bannock,"And when the old woman saw it disappearing, she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her, holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other."
the-wee-bannock,"But she was old, and the bannock was young, and it ran faster than she did, and escaped over the hill behind the house."
the-wee-bannock,"It ran, and it ran, and it ran, until it came to a large newly thatched cottage, and, as the door was open, it took refuge inside, and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire, which was burning in the first room that it came to."
the-wee-bannock,"Now, it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor, and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross-legged on the top of a big table by the window, sewing away with all their might, while the tailor's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint."
the-wee-bannock,"When the wee bannock came trundling across the floor, all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the Master Tailor's wife."
the-wee-bannock,"""Hoot,"" she said, ""what a set of cowards ye be! It is but a nice wee bannock. Get hold of it and divide it between you, and I'll fetch you all a drink of milk."""
the-wee-bannock,"So she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards, and the tailor jumped up with his great shears, and one apprentice grasped the line measure, while another took up the saucer full of pins; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock."
the-wee-bannock,"But it dodged them round and round the fire, and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road, with one of the apprentices after it, who tried to snip it in two with his shears."
the-wee-bannock,"It ran too quickly for him, however, and at last he stopped and went back to the house, while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside."
the-wee-bannock,"It trundled in at the door, and there was a weaver sitting at his loom, with his wife beside him, winding a clue of yarn."
the-wee-bannock,"""What's that, Tibby?"" said the weaver, with a start as the little cake flew past him."
the-wee-bannock,"""Oh!"" cried she in delight, jumping to her feet, ""It is a wee bannock. I wonder where it came from?"""
the-wee-bannock,"""Dinna bother your head about that, Tibby,"" said her man, ""but grip it, my woman, grip it."""
the-wee-bannock,But it was not so easy to get hold of the wee bannock.
the-wee-bannock,"It was in vain that the Goodwife threw her clue at it, and that the Goodman tried to chase it into a corner and knock it down with his shuttle."
the-wee-bannock,"It dodged, and turned, and twisted, like a thing bewitched, till at last it flew out at the door again, and vanished down the hill, ""for all the world,"" as the old woman said, ""like a new tarred sheep, or a daft cow."""
the-wee-bannock,"In the next house that it came to it found the Goodwife in the kitchen, kirning."
the-wee-bannock,"She had just filled her kirn, and there was still some cream standing in the bottom of her cream jar."
the-wee-bannock,"""Come away, little bannock,"" she cried when she saw it."
the-wee-bannock,"""Thou art come in just the nick of time, for I am beginning to feel hungry, and I'll have cakes and cream for my dinner."""
the-wee-bannock,"But the wee bannock hopped round to the other side of the kirn, and the Goodwife after it."
the-wee-bannock,"And she was in such a hurry that she nearly upset the kirn; and by the time that she had put it right again, the wee bannock was out at the door and half-way down the brae to the mill."
the-wee-bannock,"The miller was sifting meal in the trough, but he straightened himselfup when he saw the little cake."
the-wee-bannock,"""It's a sign of plenty when bannocks are running about with no one to look after them,"" he said; ""but I like bannocks and cheese, so just come in, and I will give thee a night's lodging."""
the-wee-bannock,"But the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller, so it turned and ran out of the mill, and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it."
the-wee-bannock,"After this it ran on, and on, and on, till it came to the smithy, and it popped in there to see what it could see."
the-wee-bannock,"The smith was busy at the anvil making horse-shoe nails, but he looked up as the wee bannock entered."
the-wee-bannock,"""If there be one thing I am fond of, it is a glass of ale and a well-toasted cake,"" he cried."
the-wee-bannock,"""So come inside here, and welcome to you."""
the-wee-bannock,"But as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale, it turned and ran out of the smithy as fast as it could, and the disappointed smith picked up his hammer and ran after it."
the-wee-bannock,"And when he saw that he could not catch it, he flung his heavy hammer at it, in the hope of knocking it down, but, luckily for the little cake, he missed his aim."
the-wee-bannock,"After this the bannock came to a farmhouse, with a great stack of peats standing at the back of it."
the-wee-bannock,"In it went, and ran to the fireside."
the-wee-bannock,"In this house the master had all the lint spread out on the floor, and was cloving it with an iron rod, while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven."
the-wee-bannock,"""Oh, Janet,"" cried the Goodman in surprise, ""here comes in a little bannock. It looks rare and good to eat. I'll have one half of it."""
the-wee-bannock,"""And I'll have the other half,"" cried the Goodwife."
the-wee-bannock,"""Hit it over the back with your cloving-stick, Sandy, and knock it down. Quick, or it will be out at the door again."""
the-wee-bannock,"But the bannock played ""jook-about,"" and dodged behind a chair."
the-wee-bannock,"""Hoot!"" cried Janet contemptuously, for she thought that her husband might easily have hit it, and she threw her heckle at it."
the-wee-bannock,"But the heckle missed it, just as her husband's cloving-rod had done, for it played ""jook-about"" again, and flew out of the house."
the-wee-bannock,This time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standing among the heather.
the-wee-bannock,"Here the Goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire, and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow."
the-wee-bannock,"""Oh, Jock! come here, come here,"" cried the Goodwife."
the-wee-bannock,"""You are crying for a little bannock for your supper; come here, histie, quick, and help me to catch it."""
the-wee-bannock,"""Ay, ay,"" assented Jock, jumping to his feet and hurrying across the little room."
the-wee-bannock,"""But where is it? I cannot see it."""
the-wee-bannock,"""There, man, there,"" cried his wife, ""under that chair. Run thou to that side; I will keep to this."""
the-wee-bannock,"So Jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair; but, in his hurry, he tripped and fell, and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door."
the-wee-bannock,"Through the whins and up the hillside it ran, and over the top of the hill, to a shepherd's cottage on the other side."
the-wee-bannock,"The inmates were just sitting down to their porridge, and the Goodwife was scraping the pan."
the-wee-bannock,"""Save us and help us,"" she exclaimed, stopping with the spoon half-way to her mouth."
the-wee-bannock,"""There's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our fireside."""
the-wee-bannock,"""Sneck the door,"" cried the husband, ""and we'll try to catch it. It would come in handy after the porridge."""
the-wee-bannock,But the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit.
the-wee-bannock,"It turned and ran as fast as it could, and the shepherd and his wife and all the bairns ran after it, with their spoons in their hands, in hopes of catching it."
the-wee-bannock,"And when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could, he threw his bonnet at it, and almost struck it; but it escaped all these dangers, and soon it came to another house, where the folk were just going to bed."
the-wee-bannock,"The Goodman was half undressed, and the Goodwife was raking the cinders carefully out of the fire."
the-wee-bannock,"""What's that?"" said he, ""for the bowl of brose that I had at supper-time wasn't very big."""
the-wee-bannock,"""Catch it, then,"" answered his wife, ""and I'll have a bit, too. Quick! quick! Throw your coat over it or it will be away."""
the-wee-bannock,"So the Goodman threw his coat right on the top of the little bannock,and almost managed to smother it; but it struggled bravely, and got out,breathless and hot, from under it."
the-wee-bannock,"Then it ran out into the grey light again, for night was beginning to fall, and the Goodman ran out after it, without his coat."
the-wee-bannock,"He chased it and chased it through the stackyard and across a field, and in amongst a fine patch of whins."
the-wee-bannock,"Then he lost it; and, as he was feeling cold without his coat, he went home."
the-wee-bannock,"As for the poor little bannock, it thought that it would creep under a whin bush and lie there till morning, but it was so dark that it never saw that there was a fox's hole there."
the-wee-bannock,"So it fell down the fox's hole, and the fox was very glad to see it, for he had had no food for two days."
the-wee-bannock,"""Oh, welcome, welcome,"" he cried; and he snapped it through the middle with his teeth, and that was the end of the poor wee bannock."
the-wee-bannock,"And if a moral be wanted for this tale, here it is: That people should never be too uplifted or too cast down over anything, for all the good folk in the story thought that they were going to get the bannock, and, lo and behold!"
the-wee-bannock,the fox got it after all.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"There was once upon a time a King who had a wife with golden hair, and she was so beautiful that you couldn't find anyone like her in the world."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"It happened that she fell ill, and when she felt that she must soon die, she sent for the King, and said, 'If you want to marry after my death, make no one queen unless she is just as beautiful as I am, and has just such golden hair as I have. Promise me this.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"After the King had promised her this, she closed her eyes and died."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"For a long time the King was not to be comforted, and he did not even think of taking a second wife."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"At last his councillors said, 'The King must marry again, so that we may have a queen.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,So messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late Queen in beauty.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But there was no one in the wide world, and if there had been she could not have had such golden hair."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then the messengers came home again, not having been able to find a queen."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Now, the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had just such golden hair."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"One day when she had grown up, her father looked at her, and saw that she was exactly like her mother, so he said to his councillors, 'I will marry my daughter to one of you, and she shall be queen, for she is exactly like her dead mother, and when I die her husband shall be king.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But when the Princess heard of her father's decision, she was not at all pleased, and said to him, 'Before I do your bidding, I must have three dresses; one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars. Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But she thought to herself, 'This will be quite impossible, and I shall not have to marry someone I do not care for.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The King, however, was not to be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak to be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and said, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the Princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she determined to flee away."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"In the night, when everyone else was sleeping, she got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a little gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and star dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made her face and hands black with soot."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then she commended herself to God, and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large forest."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree and fell asleep.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The sun rose and she still slept on and on, although it was nearly noon."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Now, it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran round and round it, barking."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The King said to the huntsmen, 'See what sort of a wild beast is in there.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The huntsmen went in, and then came back and said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we don't know, and we have never seen one like it; its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur; but it is lying down asleep.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The King said, 'See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the cart, and we will take it with us.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the huntsmen seized the maiden, she awoke and was frightened, and cried out to them, 'I am a poor child, forsaken by father and mother; take pity on me, and let me go with you.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then they said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can work in the kitchen; come with us and sweep the ashes together.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,So they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"There they showed her a tiny room under the stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can live and sleep here.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then she was sent into the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed vegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,So the Many-furred Creature lived for a long time in great poverty.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Ah, beautiful King's daughter, what is going to befall you now?"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"It happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace, that she said to the cook, 'Can I go upstairs for a little bit and look on? I will stand outside the doors.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The cook replied, 'Yes, you can go up, but in half-an-hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then she took her little oil-lamp, and went into her little room, drew off her fur cloak, and washed off the soot from her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth, and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then she opened the nut, and took out the dress as golden as the sun."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"And when she had done this, she went up to the feast, and everyone stepped out of her way, for nobody knew her, and they thought she must be a King's daughter."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But the King came towards her and gave her his hand, and danced with her, thinking to himself, 'My eyes have never beheld anyone so fair!'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the dance was ended, she curtseyed to him, and when the King looked round she had disappeared, no one knew whither."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The guards who were standing before the palace were called and questioned, but no one had seen her."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"She had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress, made her face and hands black, put on the fur cloak, and was once more the Many-furred Creature."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When she came into the kitchen and was setting about her work of sweeping the ashes together, the cook said to her, 'Let that wait till to-morrow, and just cook the King's soup for me; I want to have a little peep at the company upstairs; but be sure that you do not let a hair fall into it, otherwise you will get nothing to eat in future!'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"So the cook went away, and the Many-furred Creature cooked the soup for the King."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"She made a bread-soup as well as she possibly could, and when it was done, she fetched her gold ring from her little room, and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the dance was ended, the King had his soup brought to him and ate it, and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in his life."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring lying there, and he could not imagine how it got in."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,Then he commanded the cook to be brought before him.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The cook was terrified when he heard the command, and said to the Many-furred Creature, 'You must have let a hair fall into the soup, and if you have you deserve a good beating!'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When he came before the King, the King asked who had cooked the soup."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The cook answered, 'I cooked it.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But the King said, 'That's not true, for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever cooked.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then the cook said, 'I must confess; I did not cook the soup; the Many-furred Creature did.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"'Let her be brought before me,' said the King."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she was."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,'I am a poor child without father or mother.'
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then he asked her, 'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,he asked.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"So the King could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"He answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King the bread-soup that he likes so much.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"So she ran away to her little room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver as the moon and put it on."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then she went upstairs looking just like a King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King could not see which way she went."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"She ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the kitchen to cook the bread-soup."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the cook was upstairs, she fetched the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as the last time."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"He had the cook sent to him, and again he had to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then the Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The cook said, 'You must be a witch, Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Now she put on the dress as shining as the stars, and stepped into the hall in it."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had never looked so beautiful."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"She ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining white."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"The Many-furred Creature now ran into the kitchen, cooked the King's bread-soup, and when the cook had gone, she laid the gold reel in the dish."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"When the King found the reel at the bottom, he had the Many-furred Creature brought to him, and then he saw the white finger, and the ring which he had put on her hand in the dance."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Then he took her hand and held her tightly, and as she was trying to get away, she undid the fur-cloak a little bit and the star-dress shone out."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,The King seized the cloak and tore it off her.
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"Her golden hair came down, and she stood there in her full splendour, and could not hide herself away any more."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"And when the soot and ashes had been washed from her face, she looked more beautiful than anyone in the world."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,"But the King said, 'You are my dear bride, and we will never be separated from one another.'"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,So the wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after.
the-miserly-farmer,Once upon a time there was a farmer who had carted pears to market.
the-miserly-farmer,"Since they were very sweet and fragrant, he hoped to get a good price for them."
the-miserly-farmer,A bonze with a torn cap and tattered robe stepped up to his cart and asked for one.
the-miserly-farmer,"The farmer repulsed him, but the bonze did not go."
the-miserly-farmer,Then the farmer grew angry and began to call him names.
the-miserly-farmer,"The bonze said: ""You have pears by the hundred in your cart. I only ask for one. Surely that does you no great injury. Why suddenly grow so angry about it?"""
the-miserly-farmer,The bystanders told the farmer that he ought to give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go.
the-miserly-farmer,But the farmer would not and did not.
the-miserly-farmer,"An artisan saw the whole affair from his shop, and since the noise annoyed him, he took some money, bought a pear and gave it to the bonze."
the-miserly-farmer,"The bonze thanked him and said: ""One like myself, who has given up the world, must not be miserly. I have beautiful pears myself, and I invite you all to eat them with me."""
the-miserly-farmer,"Then some one asked: ""If you have pears then why do you not eat your own?"""
the-miserly-farmer,"He answered: ""I first must have a seed to plant."""
the-miserly-farmer,And with that he began to eat the pear with gusto.
the-miserly-farmer,"When he had finished, he held the pit in his hand, took his pick-ax from his shoulder; and dug a hole a couple of inches deep."
the-miserly-farmer,"Into this he thrust the pit, and covered it with earth."
the-miserly-farmer,"Then he asked the folk in the market place for water, with which to water it."
the-miserly-farmer,"A pair of curiosity seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street, and with it the bonze watered the pit."
the-miserly-farmer,Thousands of eyes were turned on the spot.
the-miserly-farmer,And the pit could already be seen to sprout.
the-miserly-farmer,The sprout grew and in a moment it had turned into a tree.
the-miserly-farmer,Branches and leaves burgeoned out from it.
the-miserly-farmer,"It began to blossom and soon the fruit had ripened: large, fragrant pears, which hung in thick clusters from the boughs."
the-miserly-farmer,The bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to the bystanders.
the-miserly-farmer,In a moment all the pears had been eaten up.
the-miserly-farmer,Then the bonze took his pick-ax and cut down the tree.
the-miserly-farmer,"Crash, crash!"
the-miserly-farmer,"so it went for a while, and the tree was felled."
the-miserly-farmer,Then he took the tree on his shoulder and walked away at an easy gait.
the-miserly-farmer,"When the bonze had begun to make his magic, the farmer, too, had mingled with the crowd."
the-miserly-farmer,With neck outstretched and staring eyes he had stood there and had entirely forgotten the business he hoped to do with his pears.
the-miserly-farmer,When the bonze had gone off he turned around to look after his cart.
the-miserly-farmer,His pears had all disappeared.
the-miserly-farmer,Then he realized that the pears the bonze had divided had been his own.
the-miserly-farmer,"He looked more closely, and the axle of his cart had disappeared."
the-miserly-farmer,It was plainly evident that it had been chopped off quite recently.
the-miserly-farmer,The farmer fell into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could.
the-miserly-farmer,"And when he turned the corner, there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall."
the-miserly-farmer,And then he realized that the pear-tree which the bonze had chopped down must have been his axle.
the-miserly-farmer,"The bonze, however, was nowhere to be found."
the-miserly-farmer,And the whole crowd in the market burst out into loud laughter.
self-did-it,"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind flour, because such strange things kept happening there."
self-did-it,"But there was a poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during the night."
self-did-it,"""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."""
self-did-it,"But the woman said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her children to eat."
self-did-it,So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night and grind some flour.
self-did-it,"When she came, she lit a fire under a big tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the fire, and began to knit."
self-did-it,After a time a girl came in and nodded to her.
self-did-it,"""Good evening!"""
self-did-it,said she to the woman.
self-did-it,"""Good evening!"" said the woman; kept her seat, and went on knitting."
self-did-it,But then the girl who had come in began to pull apart the fire on the hearth.
self-did-it,The woman built it up again.
self-did-it,"""What is your name?"" asked the girl from underground."
self-did-it,"""Self is my name,"" said the woman."
self-did-it,"That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she once more began to pull the fire apart."
self-did-it,"Then the woman grew angry and began to scold, and built it all up again."
self-did-it,"Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the fire, the woman upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground."
self-did-it,"Then the latter screamed and ran away, crying: ""Father, father! Self burned me!"""
self-did-it,"""Nonsense, if self did it, then self must suffer for it!"""
self-did-it,came the answer from below the hill.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"A young Prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him, when he came to a deep open ditch."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"He was turning aside to avoid it, when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"He dismounted from his horse, and stepped along in the direction the sound came from."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"To his astonishment he found an old woman, who begged him to help her out of the ditch."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"'My son,' answered the old woman, 'I am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight I set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning; but I lost my way in the dark, and fell into this deep ditch, where I might have remained for ever but for your kindness.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Then the Prince said to her, 'You can hardly walk; I will put you on my horse and lead you home. Where do you live?'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"'Over there, at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance,' replied the old woman."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince lifted her on to his horse, and soon they reached the hut, where the old woman got down, and turning to the Prince said, 'Just wait a moment, and I will give you something.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"And she disappeared into her hut, but returned very soon and said, 'You are a mighty Prince, but at the same time you have a kind heart, which deserves to be rewarded. Would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife?'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"'Most certainly I would,' replied the Prince."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"So the old woman continued, 'The most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the Queen of the Flowers, who has been captured by a dragon. If you wish to marry her, you must first set her free, and this I will help you to do. I will give you this little bell: if you ring it once, the King of the Eagles will appear; if you ring it twice, the King of the Foxes will come to you; and if you ring it three times, you will see the King of the Fishes by your side. These will help you if you are in any difficulty. Now farewell, and heaven prosper your undertaking.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"She handed him the little bell, and there disappeared hut and all, as though the earth had swallowed her up."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"When it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy, and putting the little bell carefully in his pocket, he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free, and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid."
the-flower-queens-daughter,So the next morning the Prince mounted his fine horse and left his home.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"He had roamed round the world for a whole year, and his horse had died of exhaustion, while he himself had suffered much from want and misery, but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"At last one day he came to a hut, in front of which sat a very old man."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince asked him, 'Do you not know where the Dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the Flower Queen prisoner?'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"'No, I do not,' answered the old man. ' But if you go straight along this road for a year, you will reach a hut where my father lives, and possibly he may be able to tell you.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince thanked him for his information, and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road, and at the end of it came to the little hut, where he found a very old man."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"He asked him the same question, and the old man answered, 'No, I do not know where the Dragon lives. But go straight along this road for another year, and you will come to a hut in which my father lives. I know he can tell you.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"And so the Prince wandered on for another year, always on the same road, and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"He put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson; but this time the old man answered, 'The Dragon lives up there on the mountain, and he has just begun his year of sleep. For one whole year he is always awake, and the next he sleeps. But if you wish to see the Flower Queen's daughter go up the second mountain: the Dragon's old mother lives there, and she has a ball every night, to which the Flower Queen's daughter goes regularly.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"So the Prince went up the second mountain, where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"He opened the big gate leading into the courtyard, and was just going to walk in, when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted?"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince replied, 'I have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the Dragon's Mother, and would like to enter her service.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"This flattering speech pleased the dragons, and the eldest of them said, 'Well, you may come with me, and I will take you to the Mother Dragon.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"They entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls, all made of gold and diamonds."
the-flower-queens-daughter,In the twelfth room they found the Mother Dragon seated on a diamond throne.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"She was the ugliest woman under the sun, and, added to it all, she had three heads."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Her appearance was a great shock to the Prince, and so was her voice, which was like the croaking of many ravens."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"She asked him, 'Why have you come here?'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince answered at once, 'I have heard so much of your beauty and kindness, that I would very much like to enter your service.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"'Very well,' said the Mother Dragon; 'but if you wish to enter my service, you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days; but if you don't bring her home safely every evening, we will eat you up.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,The Prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow.
the-flower-queens-daughter,But no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince sought for her in vain, and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"As he sat thus lost in thought, he noticed an eagle flying over his head."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell, and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"In a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him, and the King of the Eagles sank at his feet."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"'I know what you want of me,' the bird said."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"'You are looking for the Mother Dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds. I will summon all the eagles of the air together, and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,And with these words the King of the Eagles flew away.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Towards evening the Prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air, and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them."
the-flower-queens-daughter,They sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Then the Prince rode home to the old Mother Dragon, who was full of wonder when she saw him, and said, 'You have succeeded to-day in looking after my mare, and as a reward you shall come to my ball to-night.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"She gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper, and led him to a big room where several young he-dragons and she-dragons were dancing together."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Here, too, was the Flower Queen's beautiful daughter."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world, and her complexion was like lilies and roses."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"As the Prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear, 'I have come to set you free!'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Then the beautiful girl said to him, 'If you succeed in bringing the mare back safely the third day, ask the Mother Dragon to give you a foal of the mare as a reward.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The ball came to an end at midnight, and early next morning the Prince again led the Mother Dragon's mare out into the meadow."
the-flower-queens-daughter,But again she vanished before his eyes.
the-flower-queens-daughter,Then he took out his little bell and rang it twice.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"In a moment the King of the Foxes stood before him and said: 'I know already what you want, and will summon all the foxes of the world together to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"With these words the King of the Foxes disappeared, and in the evening many thousand foxes brought the mare to the Prince."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Then he rode home to the Mother-Dragon, from whom he received this time a cloak made of silver, and again she led him to the ball-room."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Flower Queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound, and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear: ' If you succeed again to-morrow, wait for me with the foal in the meadow. After the ball we will fly away together.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,On the third day the Prince led the mare to the meadow again; but once more she vanished before his eyes.
the-flower-queens-daughter,Then the Prince took out his little bell and rang it three times.
the-flower-queens-daughter,"In a moment the King of the Fishes appeared, and said to him: 'I know quite well what you want me to do, and I will summon all the fishes of the sea together, and tell them to bring you back the mare, who is hiding herself in a river.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Towards evening the mare was returned to him, and when he led her home to the Mother Dragon she said to him: 'You are a brave youth, and I will make you my body-servant. But what shall I give you as a reward to begin with?'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince begged for a foal of the mare, which the Mother Dragon at once gave him, and over and above, a cloak made of gold, for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"So in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak; but before the entertainment was over he slipped away, and went straight to the stables, where he mounted his foal and rode out into the meadow to wait for the Flower Queen's daughter."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"Towards midnight the beautiful girl appeared, and placing her in front of him on his horse, the Prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the Flower Queen's dwelling."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"But the dragons had noticed their flight, and woke their brother out of his year's sleep."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"He flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened, and determined to lay siege to the Flower Queen's palace; but the Queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling, through which no one could force a way."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"When the Flower Queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the Prince, she said to him: 'I will give my consent to your marriage gladly, but my daughter can only stay with you in summer. In winter, when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow, she must come and live with me in my palace underground.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The Prince consented to this, and led his beautiful bride home, where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"The young couple lived happily together till winter came, when the Flower Queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"In summer she returned to her husband, and their life of joy and happiness began again, and lasted till the approach of winter, when the Flower Queen's daughter went back again to her mother."
the-flower-queens-daughter,"This coming and going continued all her life long, and in spite of it they always lived happily together."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Once upon a time there was a fisherman, who lived near the king's castle, and caught fish for the king's table."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"One day when he had gone fishing, he could not catch a thing."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Try as he might, no matter how he baited or flung, not the tiniest fish would bite; but when this had gone on for a while, a head rose from the water and said: ""If you will give me the first new thing that has come into your house, you shall catch fish a-plenty!"""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then the man agreed quickly, for he could think of no new thing that might have come into the house."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"So he caught fish all day long, and as many as he could wish for, as may well be imagined."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"But when he got home, he found that heaven had sent him a little son, the first new thing to come into the house since he had made his promise."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"And when he told his wife about it, she began to weep and wail, and pray to God because of the vow her husband had made."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"And the woman's grief was reported at the castle, and when it came to the king's ears, and he learned the reason, he promised to take the boy and see if he could not save him."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"And so the king took him and brought him up as though he were his own son, until he was grown."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then one day the boy asked whether he might not go out fishing with his father, he wanted to so very much, said he."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"The king would not hear of it; but at last he was given permission, so he went to his father, and everything went well all day long, until they came home in the evening."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then the son found he had forgotten his handkerchief, and went down to the boat to get it."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"But no sooner was he in the boat than it moved off with a rush, and no matter how hard the youth worked against it with the oars, it was all in vain."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"The boat drove on and on, all night long, and at last he came to a white strand, far, far away."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"He stepped ashore, and after he had gone a while he met an old man with a great, white beard."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""What is this country called?"" asked the youth."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""Whiteland,"" was the man's answer, and he asked the youth where he came from, and what he wanted, and the latter told him."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""If you keep right on along the shore,"" said the man, ""you will come to three princesses, buried in the earth so that only their heads show. Then the first will call you--and she is the oldest--and beg you very hard to come to her and help her; and the next will do the same; but you must go to neither of them; walk quickly past them, and act as though you neither saw nor heard them. But go up to the third, and do what she asks of you, for then you will make your fortune."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"When the youth came to the first princess, she called out to him, and begged him most earnestly to come to her; but he went on as though he had not seen her."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,And he passed the next one in the same manner; but went over to the third.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""If you will do what I tell you to, you shall have whichever one of us you want,"" said she."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Yes, he would do what she wanted."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,So she told him that three trolls had wished them into the earth where they were; but that formerly they had dwelt in the castle he saw on the edge of the forest.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""Now you must go to the castle, and let the trolls whip you one night through for each one of us,"" said she, ""and if you can hold out, you will have delivered us."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""Yes,"" said the youth, he could manage that."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""When you go in,"" added the princess, ""you will find two lions standing by the door; but if you pass directly between them, they will do you no harm. Go on into a dark little room and lie down, and then the troll will come and beat you; but after that you must take the bottle that hangs on the wall, and anoint yourself where he has beaten you, and you will be whole again. And take the sword that hangs beside the bottle, and kill the troll with it."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"He did as the princess had told him, passed between the lions as though he did not see them, and right into the little room, where he lay down."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"The first night a troll with three heads and three whips came, and beat the youth badly; but he held out, and when the troll had finished, he took the bottle and anointed himself, grasped the sword and killed the troll."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,When he came out in the morning the princesses were out of the ground up to their waists.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"The next night it was the same; but the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips, and beat him worse than the first one."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"But when he came out in the morning, the princesses were out of the ground up to their ankles."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"The third night came a troll who had nine heads and nine whips, and he beat and whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then the troll took him and flung him against the wall, and as he did so the bottle fell down, and its whole contents poured over the youth, and he was at once sound and whole again."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then he did not delay, but grasped the sword, killed the troll, and when he came out in the morning, the princesses were entirely out of the ground."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"So he chose the youngest of them to be his queen, and lived long with her in peace and happiness."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"But at last he was minded to travel home, and see how his parents fared."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"This did not suit his queen; but since he wanted to go so badly, and finally was on the point of departure, she said to him: ""One thing you must promise me, that you will only do what your father tells you to do, but not what your mother tells you to do."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,And this he promised.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,Then she gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"So he wished himself home, and his parents could not get over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"When he had been home a few days, his mother wanted him to go up to the castle and show the king what a man he had grown to be."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"His father said: ""No, he had better not do that, for we will have to do without him in the meantime."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"But there was no help for it, the mother begged and pleaded until he went."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,When he got there he was more splendidly dressed and fitted out than the other king.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"This did not suit the latter, and he said: ""You can see what my queen looks like, but I cannot see yours; and I do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""God grant she were standing here, then you would see soon enough!"" said the young king, and there she stood that very minute."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"But she was very sad, and said to him: ""Why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father? Now I must go straight home, and you have used up both of your wishes."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"With that she bound a ring with her name on it in his hair, and wished herself home."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then the young king grew very sad, and went about day in, day out, with no other thought than getting back to his queen."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""I must try and see whether I cannot find out where Whiteland is,"" thought he, and wandered forth into the wide world."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,After he had gone a while he came to a hill; and there he met one who was the lord of all the beasts of the forest--for they came when he blew his horn--and him the king asked where Whiteland was.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""That I do not know,"" said he, ""but I will ask my beasts."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then he called them up with his horn, and asked whether any of them knew where Whiteland might be; but none of them knew anything about it."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,Then the man gave him a pair of snowshoes.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""If you stand in them,"" said he, ""you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles further on. He is the lord of the birds of the air. Ask him. When you have found him, turn the snowshoes around so that they point this way, and they will come back home of their own accord."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"When the king got there, he turned the snowshoes around, as the lord of the beasts had told him, and they ran home again."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"He asked about Whiteland, and the man called up all the birds with his horn, and asked whether any of them knew where Whiteland might be."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,But none of them knew.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Long after the rest an old eagle came along; and he had been out for some ten years, but did not know either."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""Well,"" said the man, ""I will lend you a pair of snowshoes. When you stand in them you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles further on. He is the lord of all the fishes in the sea. Ask him. But do not forget to turn the snowshoes around again."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"The king thanked him, stepped into the snowshoes, and when he came to the one who was lord of all the fishes in the sea, he turned them around, and they ran back like the others."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,There he once more asked about Whiteland.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"The man called up his fishes with his horn, but none of them knew anything about it."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"At last there came an old, old carp, whom he had called with his horn only at the cost of much trouble."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"When he asked him, he said: ""Yes, I know it well, for I was cook there for fully ten years. To-morrow I have to go back again, because our queen, whose king has not come home again, is going to marry some one else."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""If such be the case,"" said the man, ""I'll give you a bit of advice. Out there by the wall three brothers have been standing for the last hundred years, fighting with each other about a hat, a cloak and a pair of boots. Any one who has these three things can make himself invisible, and wish himself away as far as ever he will. You might say that you would test their possessions, and then decide their quarrel for them."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"Then the king thanked him, and did as he said."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""Why do you stand there fighting till the end of time?"" said he to the brothers."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""Let me test your possessions if I am to decide your quarrel."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"That suited them; but when he had hat, cloak and boots, he told them: ""I will give you my decision the next time we meet!"" and with that he wished himself far away."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,While he was flying through the air he happened to meet the North Wind.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""And where are you going?"" asked the North Wind."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""To Whiteland,"" said the king, and then he told him what had happened to him."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"""Well,"" said the North Wind, ""you are traveling a little quicker than I am; for I must sweep and blow out every corner. But when you come to your journey's end, stand on the steps beside the door, and then I'll tt. And when the prince who is to have the queen comes and looks out to see what it all means, I'll just take him along with me."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,The king did as the North Wind told him.
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"He stationed himself on the steps; and when the North Wind came roaring and rushing up, and laid hold of the castle walls till they fairly shook, the prince came out to see what it was all about."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"But that very moment the king seized him by the collar, and threw him out, and the North Wind took him and carried him off."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"When he had borne him away, the king went into the castle."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,"At first the queen did not recognize him, for he had grown thin and pale because he had wandered so long in his great distress; but when he showed her the ring, she grew glad at heart, and then they had a wedding which was such a wedding that the news of it spread far and wide."
the-enchanted-deer,"A young man was out walking one day in Erin, leading a stout cart-horse by the bridle."
the-enchanted-deer,"He was thinking of his mother and how poor they were since his father, who was a fisherman, had been drowned at sea, and wondering what he should do to earn a living for both of them."
the-enchanted-deer,"Suddenly a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a voice said to him: 'Will you sell me your horse, son of the fisherman?' and looking up he beheld a man standing in the road with a gun in his hand, a falcon on his shoulder, and a dog by his side."
the-enchanted-deer,'What will you give me for my horse?' asked the youth.
the-enchanted-deer,"'Will you give me your gun, and your dog, and your falcon?'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'I will give them,' answered the man, and he took the horse, and the youth took the gun and the dog and the falcon, and went home with them."
the-enchanted-deer,"But when his mother heard what he had done she was very angry, and beat him with a stick which she had in her hand."
the-enchanted-deer,"'That will teach you to sell my property,' said she, when her arm was quite tired, but Ian her son answered her nothing, and went off to his bed, for he was very sore."
the-enchanted-deer,"That night he rose softly, and left the house carrying the gun with him."
the-enchanted-deer,"'I will not stay here to be beaten,' thought he, and he walked and he walked and he walked, till it was day again, and he was hungry and looked about him to see if he could get anything to eat."
the-enchanted-deer,"Not very far off was a farm-house, so he went there, and knocked at the door, and the farmer and his wife begged him to come in, and share their breakfast."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Ah, you have a gun,' said the farmer as the young man placed it in a corner."
the-enchanted-deer,"'That is well, for a deer comes every evening to eat my corn, and I cannot catch it. It is fortune that has sent you to me.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'I will gladly remain and shoot the deer for you,' replied the youth, and that night he hid himself and watched till the deer came to the cornfield; then he lifted his gun to his shoulder and was just going to pull the trigger, when, behold!"
the-enchanted-deer,"instead of a deer, a woman with long black hair was standing there."
the-enchanted-deer,"At this sight his gun almost dropped from his hand in surprise, but as he looked, there was the deer eating the corn again."
the-enchanted-deer,"And thrice this happened, till the deer ran away over the moor, and the young man after her."
the-enchanted-deer,"On they went, on and on and one, till they reached a cottage which was thatched with heather."
the-enchanted-deer,"With a bound the deer sprang on the roof, and lay down where none could see her, but as she did so she called out, 'Go in, fisher's son, and eat and drink while you may.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"So he entered and found food and wine on the table, but no man, for the house belonged to some robbers, who were still away at their wicked business."
the-enchanted-deer,"After Ian, the fisher's son, had eaten all he wanted, he hid himself behind a great cask, and very soon he heard a noise, as of men coming through the heather, and the small twigs snapping under their feet."
the-enchanted-deer,"From his dark corner he could see into the room, and he counted four and twenty of them, all big, cross-looking men."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Some one has been eating our dinner,' cried they, 'and there was hardly enough for ourselves.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'It is the man who is lying under the cask,' answered the leader."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Go and kill him, and then come and eat your food and sleep, for we must be off betimes in the morning.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"So four of them killed the fisher's son and left him, and then went to bed."
the-enchanted-deer,"By sunrise they were all out of the house, for they had far to go."
the-enchanted-deer,"And when they had disappeared the deer came off the roof, to where the dead man lay, and she shook her head over him, and wax fell from her ear, and he jumped up as well as ever."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Trust me and eat as you did before, and no harm shall happen to you,' said she."
the-enchanted-deer,"So Ian ate and drank, and fell sound asleep under the cask."
the-enchanted-deer,"In the evening the robbers arrived very tired, and crosser than they had been yesterday, for their luck had turned and they had brought back scarcely anything."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Someone has eaten our dinner again,' cried they."
the-enchanted-deer,"'It is the man under the barrel,' answered the captain."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Let four of you go and kill him, but first slay the other four who pretended to kill him last night and didn't because he is still alive.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"Then Ian was killed a second time, and after the rest of the robbers had eaten, they lay down and slept till morning."
the-enchanted-deer,No sooner were their faces touched with the sun's rays than they were up and off.
the-enchanted-deer,"Then the deer entered and dropped the healing wax on the dead man, and he was as well as ever."
the-enchanted-deer,"By this time he did not mind what befell him, so sure was he that the deer would take care of him, and in the evening that which had happened before happened again--the four robbers were put to death and the fisher's son also, but because there was no food left for them to eat, they were nearly mad with rage, and began to quarrel."
the-enchanted-deer,"From quarrelling they went on to fighting, and fought so hard that by and bye they were all stretched dead on the floor."
the-enchanted-deer,"Then the deer entered, and the fisher's son was restored to life, and bidding him follow her, she ran on to a little white cottage where dwelt an old woman and her son, who was thin and dark."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Here I must leave you,' said the deer, 'but to-morrow meet me at midday in the church that is yonder.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"And jumping across the stream, she vanished into a wood."
the-enchanted-deer,"Next day he set out for the church, but the old woman of the cottage had gone before him, and had stuck an enchanted stick called 'the spike of hurt' in a crack of the door, so that he would brush against it as he stepped across the threshold."
the-enchanted-deer,"Suddenly he felt so sleepy that he could not stand up, and throwing himself on the ground he sank into a deep slumber, not knowing that the dark lad was watching him."
the-enchanted-deer,"Nothing could waken him, not even the sound of sweetest music, nor the touch of a lady who bent over him."
the-enchanted-deer,"A sad look came on her face, as she saw it was no use, and at last she gave it up, and lifting his arm, wrote her name across the side--'the daughter of the king of the town under the waves.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'I will come to-morrow,' she whispered, though he could not hear her, and she went sorrowfully away."
the-enchanted-deer,"Then he awoke, and the dark lad told him what had befallen him, and he was very grieved."
the-enchanted-deer,But the dark lad did not tell him of the name that was written underneath his arm.
the-enchanted-deer,"On the following morning the fisher's son again went to the church, determined that he would not go to sleep, whatever happened."
the-enchanted-deer,"But in his hurry to enter he touched with his hand the spike of hurt, and sank down where he stood, wrapped in slumber."
the-enchanted-deer,"A second time the air was filled with music, and the lady came in, stepping softly, but though she laid his head on her knee, and combed his hair with a golden comb, his eyes opened not."
the-enchanted-deer,"Then she burst into tears, and placing a beautifully wrought box in his pocket she went her way."
the-enchanted-deer,"The next day the same thing befell the fisher's son, and this time the lady wept more bitterly than before, for she said it was the last chance, and she would never be allowed to come any more, for home she must go."
the-enchanted-deer,"As soon as the lady had departed the fisher's son awoke, and the dark lad told him of her visit, and how he would never see her as long as he lived."
the-enchanted-deer,"At this the fisher's son felt the cold creeping up to his heart, yet he knew the fault had not been his that sleep had overtaken him."
the-enchanted-deer,"'I will search the whole world through till I find her,' cried he, and the dark lad laughed as he heard him."
the-enchanted-deer,"But the fisher's son took no heed, and off he went, following the sun day after day, till his shoes were in holes and his feet were sore from the journey."
the-enchanted-deer,"Nought did he see but the birds that made their nests in the trees, not so much as a goat or a rabbit."
the-enchanted-deer,"On and on and on he went, till suddenly he came upon a little house, with a woman standing outside it."
the-enchanted-deer,"'All hail, fisher's son!' said she."
the-enchanted-deer,"' I know what you are seeking; enter in and rest and eat, and to-morrow I will give you what help I can, and send you on your way.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"Gladly did Ian the fisher's son accept her offer, and all that day he rested, and the woman gave him ointment to put on his feet, which healed his sores."
the-enchanted-deer,"At daybreak he got up, ready to be gone, and the woman bade him farewell, saying: 'I have a sister who dwells on the road which you must travel. It is a long road, and it would take you a year and a day to reach it, but put on these old brown shoes with holes all over them, and you will be there before you know it. Then shake them off, and turn their toes to the known, and their heels to the unknown, and they will come home of themselves.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"The fisher's son did as the woman told him, and everything happened just as she had said."
the-enchanted-deer,"But at parting the second sister said to him, as she gave him another pair of shoes: 'Go to my third sister, for she has a son who is keeper of the birds of the air, and sends them to sleep when night comes. He is very wise, and perhaps he can help you.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"Then the young man thanked her, and went to the third sister."
the-enchanted-deer,"The third sister was very kind, but had no counsel to give him, so he ate and drank and waited till her son came home, after he had sent all the birds to sleep."
the-enchanted-deer,"He thought a long while after his mother had told him the young man's story, and at last he said that he was hungry, and the cow must be killed, as he wanted some supper."
the-enchanted-deer,"So the cow was killed and the meat cooked, and a bag made of its red skin."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Now get into the bag,' bade the son, and the young man got in and took his gun with him, but the dog and the falcon he left outside."
the-enchanted-deer,"The keeper of the birds drew the string at the top of the bag, and left it to finish his supper, when in flew an eagle through the open door, and picked the bag up in her claws and carried it through the air to an island."
the-enchanted-deer,"There was nothing to eat on the island, and the fisher's son thought he would die of food, when he remembered the box that the lady had put in his pocket."
the-enchanted-deer,"He opened the lid, and three tiny little birds flew out, and flapping their wings they asked, 'Good master, is there anything we can do for thee?'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'Bear me to the kingdom of the king under the waves,' he answered, and one little bird flew on to his head, and the others perched on each of his shoulders, and he shut his eyes, and in a moment there he was in the country under the sea."
the-enchanted-deer,"Then the birds flew away, and the young man looked about him, his heart beating fast at the thought that here dwelt the lady whom he had sought all the world over."
the-enchanted-deer,"He walked on through the streets, and presently he reached the house of a weaver who was standing at his door, resting from his work."
the-enchanted-deer,"'You are a stranger here, that is plain,' said the weaver, 'but come in, and I will give you food and drink.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"And the young man was glad, for he knew not where to go, and they sat and talked till it grew late."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Stay with me, I pray, for I love company and am lonely,' observed the weaver at last, and he pointed to a bed in a corner, where the fisher's son threw himself, and slept till dawn."
the-enchanted-deer,"'There is to be a horse-race in the town to-day,' remarked the weaver, 'and the winner is to have the king's daughter to wife.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"The young man trembled with excitement at the news, and his voice shook as he answered: 'That will be a prize indeed, I should like to see the race.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'Oh, that is quite easy--anyone can go,' replied the weaver."
the-enchanted-deer,"'I would take you myself, but I have promised to weave this cloth for the king.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'That is a pity,' returned the young man politely, but in his heart he rejoiced, for he wished to be alone."
the-enchanted-deer,"Leaving the house, he entered a grove of trees which stood behind, and took the box from his pocket."
the-enchanted-deer,"He raised the lid, and out flew the three little birds."
the-enchanted-deer,"'Good master, what shall we do for thee?' asked they, and he answered, 'Bring me the finest horse that ever was seen, and the grandest dress, and glass shoes.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"'They are here, master,' said the birds, and so they were, and never had the young man seen anything so splendid."
the-enchanted-deer,"Mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses were assembling for the great race, and took his place among them."
the-enchanted-deer,"Many good beasts were there which had won many races, but the horse of the fisher's son left them all behind, and he was first at the winning post."
the-enchanted-deer,"The king's daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize, for he went back to the wood, and got off his horse, and put on his old clothes, and bade the box place some gold in his pockets."
the-enchanted-deer,"After that he went back to the weaver's house, and told him that the gold had been given him by the man who had won the race, and that the weaver might have it for his kindness to him."
the-enchanted-deer,"Now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess, the king ordered another race to be run, and the fisher's son rode into the field still more splendidly dressed than he was before, and easily distanced everybody else."
the-enchanted-deer,"But again he left the prize unclaimed, and so it happened on the third day, when it seemed as if all the people in the kingdom were gathered to see the race, for they were filled with curiosity to know who the winner could be."
the-enchanted-deer,"'If he will not come of his own free will, he must be brought,' said the king, and the messengers who had seen the face of the victor were sent to seek him in every street of the town."
the-enchanted-deer,"This took many days, and when at last they found the young man in the weaver's cottage, he was so dirty and ugly and had such a strange appearance, that they declared he could not be the winner they had been searching for, but a wicked robber who had murdered ever so many people, but had always managed to escape. ' Yes, it must be the robber,' said the king, when the fisher's son was led into his presence; 'build a gallows at once and hang him in the sight of all my subjects, that they may behold him suffer the punishment of his crimes.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"So the gallows was built upon a high platform, and the fisher's son mounted the steps up to it, and turned at the top to make the speech that was expected from every doomed man, innocent or guilt."
the-enchanted-deer,"As he spoke he happened to raise his arm, and the king's daughter, who was there at her father's side, saw the name which she had written under it."
the-enchanted-deer,"With a shriek she sprang from her seat, and the eyes of the spectators were turned towards her."
the-enchanted-deer,'Stop! stop!'
the-enchanted-deer,"she cried, hardly knowing what she said."
the-enchanted-deer,'If that man is hanged there is not a soul in the kingdom but shall die also.'
the-enchanted-deer,"And running up to where the fisher's son was standing, she took him by the hand, saying, 'Father, this is no robber or murderer, but the victor in the three races, and he loosed the spells that were laid upon me.'"
the-enchanted-deer,"Then, without waiting for a reply, she conducted him into the palace, and he bathed in a marble bath, and all the dirt that the fairies had put upon him disappeared like magic, and when he had dressed himself in the fine garments the princess had sent to him, he looked a match for any king's daughter in Erin."
the-enchanted-deer,"He went down into the great hall where she was awaiting him, and they had much to tell each other but little time to tell it in, for the king her father, and the princes who were visiting him, and all the people of the kingdom were still in their places expecting her return."
the-enchanted-deer,'How did you find me out?'
the-enchanted-deer,she whispered as they went down the passage.
the-enchanted-deer,"'The birds in the box told me,' answered he, but he could say no more, as they stepped out into the open space that was crowded with people."
the-enchanted-deer,There the princes stopped.
the-enchanted-deer,' O kings!'
the-enchanted-deer,"she said, turning towards them, 'if one of you were killed to-day, the rest would fly; but this man put his trust in me, and had his head cut off three times. Because he has done this, I will marry him rather than one of you, who have come hither to wed me, for many kings here sought to free me from the spells, but none could do it save Ian the fisher's son.'"
four-shilling-piece,"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far away from the village."
four-shilling-piece,"She had but little to bite and less to burn, so she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood."
four-shilling-piece,"He skipped and leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he walked."
four-shilling-piece,"When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he crossed a field of stubble."
four-shilling-piece,There he saw lying a jagged white stone.
four-shilling-piece,"""O, you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing terribly!"""
four-shilling-piece,"said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the stone."
four-shilling-piece,"And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his shirt-sleeves."
four-shilling-piece,"He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket."
four-shilling-piece,"""You fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out in the field!""--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his jacket."
four-shilling-piece,"When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had raised itself from the ground on one side."
four-shilling-piece,"""Yes, and I'm sure it is because you have the jacket, poor fellow!"" said the boy."
four-shilling-piece,"But when he looked more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver coins under the stone."
four-shilling-piece,"""That must be stolen money,"" thought the boy, ""for no one lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood."""
four-shilling-piece,"And he took the chest, and carried it down to the pond nearby, and threw in the whole pile of money."
four-shilling-piece,But a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top of the water.
four-shilling-piece,"""Well, this one is honest, for whatever is honest will float,"" said the boy."
four-shilling-piece,And he took the four-shilling piece and the jacket home with him.
four-shilling-piece,"He told his mother what had happened to him, that the stone had turned around, and that he had found a chest full of silver coins, and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money."
four-shilling-piece,"""But a four-shilling piece floated, and that I took along, because it was honest,"" said the boy."
four-shilling-piece,"""You are a fool,"" said the woman--for she was as angry as could be--""if nothing were honest save what floats on the water, there would be but little honesty left in the world. And if the money had been stolen ten times over, still you had found it, and charity begins at home. If you had kept the money, we might have passed the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. But you are a dunderhead and will stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you any longer. Now you must get out and earn your own living."""
four-shilling-piece,"So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and wandered about far and near looking for service."
four-shilling-piece,"But wherever he went people found him too small or too weak, and said that they could make no use of him."
four-shilling-piece,At last he came to a merchant.
four-shilling-piece,"There they kept him to work in the kitchen, and he had to fetch wood and water for the cook."
four-shilling-piece,"When he had been there for some time, the merchant decided to journey to far countries, and asked all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them."
four-shilling-piece,"After all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of the little fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen."
four-shilling-piece,He handed him his four-shilling piece.
four-shilling-piece,"""Well, and what am I to buy for it?"" asked the merchant."
four-shilling-piece,"""It will not be a large purchase."""
four-shilling-piece,"""Buy whatever it will bring, it is honest money, that I know,"" said the boy."
four-shilling-piece,"His master promised to do so, and sailed away."
four-shilling-piece,"Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had reloaded, and had bought what his servants had desired, he went back to his ship, and was about to shove off."
four-shilling-piece,"Not until then did he remember that the scullion had given him a four-shilling piece, with which to buy him something."
four-shilling-piece,"""Must I go up to the city again because of this four-shilling piece? One only has one's troubles when one bothers with such truck,"" thought the merchant."
four-shilling-piece,Then along came a woman with a bag on her back.
four-shilling-piece,"""What have you in your bag, granny?"" asked the merchant."
four-shilling-piece,"""O, it is only a cat! I can feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her into the sea in order to get rid of her,"" said the old woman."
four-shilling-piece,"""The boy told me to buy whatever I could get for the four-shilling piece,"" said the merchant to himself, and asked the woman whether he could have her cat for four shillings."
four-shilling-piece,"The woman agreed without delay, and the bargain was closed."
four-shilling-piece,"Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while, a terrible storm broke loose, a thunderstorm without an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and did not know where or whither."
four-shilling-piece,"At last he came to a land where he had never yet been, and went up into the city."
four-shilling-piece,"In the tavern which he entered the table was set, and at every place lay a switch, one for each guest."
four-shilling-piece,"This seemed strange to the merchant, for he could not understand what was to be done with all the switches."
four-shilling-piece,"Yet he sat down and thought: ""I will watch carefully, and see just what the rest do with them, and then I can imitate them."""
four-shilling-piece,"Yes, and when the food came on the table, then he knew why the switches were there: the place was alive with thousands of mice, and all who were sitting at the table had to work and fight and beat about them with their switches, and nothing could be heard but the slapping of the switches, one worse than the other."
four-shilling-piece,"Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and then they had to take time to say, ""Excuse me!"""
four-shilling-piece,"""Eating is hard work in this country,"" said the merchant."
four-shilling-piece,"""How is it the folk here have no cats?"""
four-shilling-piece,"""Cats?"" said the people: they did not know what they were."
four-shilling-piece,"Then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the scullion brought, and when the cat went over the table, the mice had to hurry into their holes, and not in the memory of man had the people been able to eat in such comfort."
four-shilling-piece,Then they begged and implored the merchant to sell them his cat.
four-shilling-piece,"At last he said he would let them have her; but he wanted a hundred dollars for her, and this they paid, and thanked him kindly into the bargain."
four-shilling-piece,"Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he reached the high seas than he saw the cat sitting at the top of the main-mast."
four-shilling-piece,"And immediately after another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the first one, and he drifted and drifted, till he came to a land where he had never yet been."
four-shilling-piece,"Again the merchant went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was covered with switches; but they were much larger and longer than at the place where he had first been."
four-shilling-piece,"And they were much needed; for there were a good many more mice, and they were twice the size of those he had first seen."
four-shilling-piece,"Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received two hundred dollars for her, and that without any haggling."
four-shilling-piece,"But when he had sailed off and was out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast."
four-shilling-piece,"And the storm at once began again, and finally he was again driven to a land in which he had never been."
four-shilling-piece,"Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the table was also covered with switches; but every switch was a yard and a half long, and as thick as a small broom, and the people told him that they knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down to eat, for there were great, ugly rats by the thousand."
four-shilling-piece,"Only with toil and trouble could one manage to shove a bite of something into one's mouth once in a while, so hard was it to defend oneself against the rats."
four-shilling-piece,"Then the cat was again brought from the ship, and now the people could eat in peace."
four-shilling-piece,They begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his cat; and for a long time he refused; but at last he promised that they should have her for three hundred dollars.
four-shilling-piece,"And they paid him, and thanked him, and blessed him into the bargain."
four-shilling-piece,"Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he considered how much the boy had gained with the four-shilling piece he had given him."
four-shilling-piece,"""Well, he shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him, and charity begins at home."""
four-shilling-piece,"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink."
four-shilling-piece,Then the merchant realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that the boy should have all the money.
four-shilling-piece,"No sooner had he made his vow, than the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey home."
four-shilling-piece,"And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and his daughter to boot."
four-shilling-piece,"For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness."
four-shilling-piece,And he took in his mother and treated her kindly.
four-shilling-piece,"""For I do not believe that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."
whippety-stourie,"I am going to tell you a story about a poor young widow woman, who lived in a house called Kittlerumpit, though whereabouts in Scotland the house of Kittlerumpit stood nobody knows."
whippety-stourie,"Some folk think that it stood in the neighbourhood of the Debateable Land, which, as all the world knows, was on the Borders, where the old Border Reivers were constantly coming and going; the Scotch stealing from the English, and the English from the Scotch."
whippety-stourie,"Be that as it may, the widowed Mistress of Kittlerumpit was sorely to be pitied."
whippety-stourie,"For she had lost her husband, and no one quite knew what had become of him."
whippety-stourie,"He had gone to a fair one day, and had never come back again, and although everybody believed that he was dead, no one knew how he died."
whippety-stourie,"Some people said that he had been persuaded to enlist, and had been killed in the wars; others, that he had been taken away to serve as a sailor by the press-gang, and had been drowned at sea."
whippety-stourie,"At any rate, his poor young wife was sorely to be pitied, for she was left with a little baby-boy to bring up, and, as times were bad, she had not much to live on."
whippety-stourie,"But she loved her baby dearly, and worked all day amongst her cows, and pigs, and hens, in order to earn enough money to buy food and clothes for both herself and him."
whippety-stourie,"Now, on the morning of which I am speaking, she rose very early and went out to feed her pigs, for rent-day was coming on, and she intended to take one of them, a great, big, fat creature, to the market that very day, as she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a long way towards paying her rent."
whippety-stourie,"And because she thought so, her heart was light, and she hummed a little song to herself as she crossed the yard with her bucket on one arm and her baby-boy on the other."
whippety-stourie,"But the song was quickly changed into a cry of despair when she reached the pig-stye, for there lay her cherished pig on its back, with its legs in the air and its eyes shut, just as if it were going to breathe its last breath."
whippety-stourie,"""What shall I do? What shall I do?"" cried the poor woman, sitting down on a big stone and clasping her boy to her breast, heedless of the fact that she had dropped her bucket, and that the pig's-meat was running out, and that the hens were eating it."
whippety-stourie,"""First I lost my husband, and now I am going to lose my finest pig. The pig that I hoped would fetch a deal of money."""
whippety-stourie,"Now I must explain to you that the house of Kittlerumpit stood on a hillside, with a great fir wood behind it, and the ground sloping down steeply in front."
whippety-stourie,"And as the poor young thing, after having a good cry to herself, was drying her eyes, she chanced to look down the hill, and who should she see coming up it but an Old Woman, who looked like a lady born."
whippety-stourie,"She was dressed all in green, with a white apron, and she wore a black velvet hood on her head, and a steeple-crowned beaver hat over that, something like those, as I have heard tell, that the women wear in Wales."
whippety-stourie,"She walked very slowly, leaning on a long staff, and she gave a bit hirple now and then, as if she were lame."
whippety-stourie,"As she drew near, the young widow felt it was becoming to rise and curtsey to the Gentlewoman, for such she saw her to be."
whippety-stourie,"""Madam,"" she said, with a sob in her voice, ""I bid you welcome to the house of Kittlerumpit, although you find its Mistress one of the most unfortunate women in the world."""
whippety-stourie,"""Hout-tout,"" answered the old Lady, in such a harsh voice that the young woman started, and grasped her baby tighter in her arms."
whippety-stourie,"""Ye have little need to say that. Ye have lost your husband, I grant ye, but there were waur losses at Shirra-Muir. And now your pig is like to die--I could, maybe, remedy that. But I must first hear how much ye wad gie me if I cured him."""
whippety-stourie,"""Anything that your Ladyship's Madam likes to ask,"" replied the widow, too much delighted at having the animal's life saved to think that she was making rather a rash promise."
whippety-stourie,"""Very good,"" said the old Dame, and without wasting any more words she walked straight into the pig-sty."
whippety-stourie,"She stood and looked at the dying creature for some minutes, rocking to and fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could not understand; at least, she could only understand four of them, and they sounded something like this: ""Pitter-patter, Haly water."""
whippety-stourie,Then she put her hand into her pocket and drew out a tiny bottle with a liquid that looked like oil in it.
whippety-stourie,"She took the cork out, and dropped one of her long lady-like fingers into it; then she touched the pig on the snout and on his ears, and on the tip of his curly tail."
whippety-stourie,"No sooner had she done so than up the beast jumped, and, with a grunt of contentment, ran off to its trough to look for its breakfast."
whippety-stourie,"A joyful woman was the Mistress of Kittlerumpit when she saw it do this, for she felt that her rent was safe; and in her relief and gratitude she would have kissed the hem of the strange Lady's green gown, if she would have allowed it, but she would not."
whippety-stourie,"""No, no,"" said she, and her voice sounded harsher than ever."
whippety-stourie,"""Let us have no fine meanderings, but let us stick to our bargain. I have done my part, and mended the pig; now ye must do yours, and give me what I like to ask--your son."""
whippety-stourie,"Then the poor widow gave a piteous cry, for she knew now what she had not guessed before--that the Green-clad Lady was a Fairy, and a Wicked Fairy too, else had she not asked such a terrible thing."
whippety-stourie,"It was too late now, however, to pray, and beseech, and beg for mercy; the Fairy stood her ground, hard and cruel."
whippety-stourie,"""Ye promised me what I liked to ask, and I have asked your son; and your son I will have,"" she replied, ""so it is useless making such a din about it. But one thing I may tell you, for I know well that the knowledge will not help you. By the laws of Fairy-land, I cannot take the bairn till the third day after this, and if by that time you have found out my name I cannot take him even then. But ye will not be able to find it out, of that I am certain. So I will call back for the boy in three days."""
whippety-stourie,"And with that she disappeared round the back of the pig-sty, and the poor mother fell down in a dead faint beside the stone."
whippety-stourie,"All that day, and all the next, she did nothing but sit in her kitchen and cry, and hug her baby tighter in her arms; but on the day before that on which the Fairy said that she was coming back, she felt as if she must get a little breath of fresh air, so she went for a walk in the fir wood behind the house."
whippety-stourie,"Now in this fir wood there was an old quarry hole, in the bottom of which was a bonnie spring well, the water of which was always sweet and pure."
whippety-stourie,"The young widow was walking near this quarry hole, when, to her astonishment, she heard the whirr of a spinning-wheel and the sound of a voice lilting a song."
whippety-stourie,"At first she could not think where the sound came from; then, remembering the quarry, she laid down her child at a tree root, and crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to the edge of the hole and peeped over."
whippety-stourie,She could hardly believe her eyes!
whippety-stourie,"For there, far below her, at the bottom of the quarry, beside the spring well, sat the cruel Fairy, dressed in her green frock and tall felt hat, spinning away as fast as she could at a tiny spinning-wheel."
whippety-stourie,And what should she be singing but--
whippety-stourie,"""Little kens our guid dame at hame, Whippety-Stourie is my name."""
whippety-stourie,"The widow woman almost cried aloud for joy, for now she had learned the Fairy's secret, and her child was safe."
whippety-stourie,"But she dare not, in case the wicked old Dame heard her and threw some other spell over her."
whippety-stourie,"So she crept softly back to the place where she had left her child; then, catching him up in her arms, she ran through the wood to her house, laughing, and singing, and tossing him in the air in such a state of delight that, if anyone had met her, they would have been in danger of thinking that she was mad."
whippety-stourie,"Now this young woman had been a merry-hearted maiden, and would have been merry-hearted still, if, since her marriage, she had not had so much trouble that it had made her grow old and sober-minded before her time; and she began to think what fun it would be to tease the Fairy for a few minutes before she let her know that she had found out her name."
whippety-stourie,"So next day, at the appointed time, she went out with her boy in her arms, and seated herself on the big stone where she had sat before; and when she saw the old Dame coming up the hill, she crumpled up her nice clean cap, and screwed up her face, and pretended to be in great distress and to be crying bitterly."
whippety-stourie,"The Fairy took no notice of this, however, but came close up to her, and said, in her harsh, merciless voice, ""Good wife of Kittlerumpit, ye ken the reason of my coming; give me the bairn."""
whippety-stourie,"Then the young mother pretended to be in sorer distress than ever, and fell on her knees before the wicked old woman and begged for mercy."
whippety-stourie,"""Oh, sweet Madam Mistress,"" she cried, ""spare me my bairn, and take, and thou wilt, the pig instead."""
whippety-stourie,"""We have no need of bacon where I come from,"" answered the Fairy coldly; ""so give me the laddie and let me begone--I have no time to waste in this wise."""
whippety-stourie,"""Oh, dear Lady mine,"" pleaded the Goodwife, ""if thou wilt not have the pig, wilt thou not spare my poor bairn and take me myself?"""
whippety-stourie,"The Fairy stepped back a little, as if in astonishment."
whippety-stourie,"""Art thou mad, woman,"" she cried contemptuously, ""that thou proposest such a thing? Who in all the world would care to take a plain-looking, red-eyed, dowdy wife like thee with them?"""
whippety-stourie,"Now the young Mistress of Kittlerumpit knew that she was no beauty, and the knowledge had never vexed her; but something in the Fairy's tone made her feel so angry that she could contain herself no longer."
whippety-stourie,"""In troth, fair Madam, I might have had the wit to know that the like of me is not fit to tie the shoe-string of the High and Mighty Princess, WHIPPETY-STOURIE!"""
whippety-stourie,"If there had been a charge of gunpowder buried in the ground, and if it had suddenly exploded beneath her feet, the Wicked Fairy could not have jumped higher into air."
whippety-stourie,"And when she came down again she simply turned round and ran down the brae, shrieking with rage and disappointment, for all the world, as an old book says, ""like an owl chased by witches."""
old-hop-giant,Once upon a time there were two neighbors: one of them rich and the other poor.
old-hop-giant,"They owned a great meadow in common, which they were supposed to mow together and then divide the hay."
old-hop-giant,"But the rich neighbor wanted the meadow for himself alone, and told the poor one that he would drive him out of house and home if he did not come to an agreement with him that whichever one of them mowed the largest stretch of the meadowland in a single day, should receive the entire meadow."
old-hop-giant,Now the rich neighbor got together as many mowers as ever he could; but the poor one could not hire a single man.
old-hop-giant,"At last he despaired altogether and wept, because he did not know how he could manage to get so much as a bit of hay for the cow."
old-hop-giant,"Then it was that a large man stepped up to him and said: ""Do not grieve so. I can tell you what you ought to do. When the mowing begins, just call out 'Old Hopgiant!' three times in succession, and you'll not be at a loss, as you shall see for yourself."""
old-hop-giant,And with that he disappeared.
old-hop-giant,"Then the poor man's heart grew less heavy, and he gave over worrying."
old-hop-giant,"So one fine day his rich neighbor came along with no fewer than twenty farmhands, and they mowed down one swath after another."
old-hop-giant,"But the poor neighbor did not even take the trouble to begin when he saw how the others took hold, and that he himself would not be able to do anything alone."
old-hop-giant,"Then the big man occurred to him, and he called out: ""Old Hopgiant!"""
old-hop-giant,"But no one came, and the mowers all laughed at him and mocked him, thinking he had gone out of his mind."
old-hop-giant,"Then he called again: ""Old Hopgiant!"""
old-hop-giant,"And, just as before, there was no hopgiant to be seen."
old-hop-giant,And the mowers could scarcely swing their scythes; for they were laughing fit to split.
old-hop-giant,"And then he cried for the third time: ""Old Hopgiant!"""
old-hop-giant,"And there appeared a fellow of truly horrible size, with a scythe as large as a ship's mast."
old-hop-giant,And now the merriment of the rich peasant's mowers came to an end.
old-hop-giant,"For when the giant began to mow and fling about his scythe, they were frightened at the strength he put into his work."
old-hop-giant,And before they knew it he had mown half the meadow.
old-hop-giant,"Then the rich neighbor fell into a rage, rushed up and gave the giant a good kick."
old-hop-giant,"But that did not help him, for his foot stuck to the giant, while the latter no more felt the kick than if it had been a flea-bite, and kept right on working."
old-hop-giant,"Then the rich neighbor thought of a scheme to get free, and gave the giant a kick with his other foot; but this foot also stuck fast, and there he hung like a tick."
old-hop-giant,"Old Hopgiant mowed the whole meadow, and then flew up into the air, and the rich man had to go along hanging to him like a hawser."
old-hop-giant,And thus the poor neighbor was left sole master of the place.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Long, long ago Japan was governed by Hohodemi, the fourth Mikoto (or Augustness) in descent from the illustrious Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He was not only as handsome as his ancestress was beautiful, but he was also very strong and brave, and was famous for being the greatest hunter in the land."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Because of his matchless skill as a hunter, he was called ""Yama-sachi-hiko"" or ""The Happy Hunter of the Mountains."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"His elder brother was a very skillful fisher, and as he far surpassed all rivals in fishing, he was named ""Umi-sachi-hiko"" or the ""Skillful Fisher of the Sea."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The brothers thus led happy lives, thoroughly enjoying their respective occupations, and the days passed quickly and pleasantly while each pursued his own way, the one hunting and the other fishing."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"One day the Happy Hunter came to his brother, the Skillful Fisher, and said: ""Well, my brother, I see you go to the sea every day with your fishing rod in your hand, and when you return you come laden with fish. And as for me, it is my pleasure to take my bow and arrow and to hunt the wild animals up the mountains and down in the valleys. For a long time we have each followed our favorite occupation, so that now we must both be tired, you of your fishing and I of my hunting. Would it not be wise for us to make a change? Will you try hunting in the mountains and I will go and fish in the sea?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Skillful Fisher listened in silence to his brother, and for a moment was thoughtful, but at last he answered: ""O yes, why not? Your idea is not a bad one at all. Give me your bow and arrow and I will set out at once for the mountains and hunt for game."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"So the matter was settled by this talk, and the two brothers each started out to try the other's occupation, little dreaming of all that would happen."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"It was very unwise of them, for the Happy Hunter knew nothing of fishing, and the Skillful Fisher, who was bad tempered, knew as much about hunting."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,The Happy Hunter took his brother's much-prized fishing hook and rod and went down to the seashore and sat down on the rocks.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He sat and gazed at the little float bobbing up and down in the water, and longed for a good fish to come and be caught."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Every time the buoy moved a little he pulled up his rod, but there was never a fish at the end of it, only the hook and the bait."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"If he had known how to fish properly, he would have been able to catch plenty of fish, but although he was the greatest hunter in the land he could not help being the most bungling fisher."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The whole day passed in this way, while he sat on the rocks holding the fishing rod and waiting in vain for his luck to turn."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"At last the day began to darken, and the evening came; still he had caught not a single fish."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Drawing up his line for the last time before going home, he found that he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He now began to feel extremely anxious, for he knew that his brother would be angry at his having lost his hook, for, it being his only one, he valued it above all other things."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter now set to work to look among the rocks and on the sand for the lost hook, and while he was searching to and fro, his brother, the Skillful Fisher, arrived on the scene."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He had failed to find any game while hunting that day, and was not only in a bad temper, but looked fearfully cross."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"When he saw the Happy Hunter searching about on the shore he knew that something must have gone wrong, so he said at once: ""What are you doing, my brother?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter went forward timidly, for he feared his brother's anger, and said: ""Oh, my brother, I have indeed done badly."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""What is the matter?-what have you done?"" asked the elder brother impatiently."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""I have lost your precious fishing hook-"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"While he was still speaking his brother stopped him, and cried out fiercely: ""Lost my hook! It is just what I expected. For this reason, when you first proposed your plan of changing over our occupations I was really against it, but you seemed to wish it so much that I gave in and allowed you to do as you wished. The mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen! And you have done badly. I will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook. Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter felt that he was to blame for all that had come to pass, and bore his brother's scornful scolding with humility and patience."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He hunted everywhere for the hook most diligently, but it was nowhere to be found."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He then went home, and in desperation broke his beloved sword into pieces and made five hundred hooks out of it."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He took these to his angry brother and offered them to him, asking his forgiveness, and begging him to accept them in the place of the one he had lost for him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"It was useless; his brother would not listen to him, much less grant his request."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter then made another five hundred hooks, and again took them to his brother, beseeching him to pardon him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Though you make a million hooks,"" said the Skillful Fisher, shaking his head, ""they are of no use to me. I cannot forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Nothing would appease the anger of the Skillful Fisher, for he had a bad disposition, and had always hated his brother because of his virtues, and now with the excuse of the lost fishing hook he planned to kill him and to usurp his place as ruler of Japan."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter knew all this full well, but he could say nothing, for being the younger he owed his elder brother obedience; so he returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He was much cast down, for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brother's hook now."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"While he stood on the beach, lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next, an old man suddenly appeared carrying a stick in his hand."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter afterwards remembered that he did not see from whence the old man came, neither did he know how he was there-he happened to look up and saw the old man coming towards him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""You are Hohodemi, the Augustness, sometimes called the Happy Hunter, are you not?"" asked the old man."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""What are you doing alone in such a place?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Yes, I am he,"" answered the unhappy young man."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Unfortunately, while fishing I lost my brother's precious fishing hook. I have hunted this shore all over, but alas! I cannot find it, and I am very troubled, for my brother won't forgive me till I restore it to him. But who are you?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""My name is Shiwozuchino Okina, and I live near by on this shore. I am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you. You must indeed be anxious. But if I tell you what I think, the hook is nowhere here-it is either at the bottom of the sea or in the body of some fish who has swallowed it, and for this reason, though you spend your whole life in looking for it here, you will never find it."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Then what can I do?"" asked the distressed man."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""You had better go down to Ryn Gu and tell Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, what your trouble is and ask him to find the hook for you. I think that would be the best way."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Your idea is a splendid one,"" said the Happy Hunter, ""but I fear I cannot get to the Sea King's realm, for I have always heard that it is situated at the bottom of the sea."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Oh, there will be no difficulty about your getting there,"" said the old man; ""I can soon make something for you to ride on through the sea."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Thank you,"" said the Happy Hunter, ""I shall be very grateful to you if you will be so kind."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The old man at once set to work, and soon made a basket and offered it to the Happy Hunter."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He received it with joy, and taking it to the water, mounted it, and prepared to start."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He bade good by to the kind old man who had helped him so much, and told him that he would certainly reward him as soon as he found his hook and could return to Japan without fear of his brother's anger."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The old man pointed out the direction he must take, and told him how to reach the realm of Ryn Gu, and watched him ride out to sea on the basket, which resembled a small boat."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter made all the haste he could, riding on the basket which had been given him by his friend."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"His queer boat seemed to go through the water of its own accord, and the distance was much shorter than he had expected, for in a few hours he caught sight of the gate and the roof of the Sea King's Palace."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"And what a large place it was, with its numberless sloping roofs and gables, its huge gateways, and its gray stone walls!"
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He soon landed, and leaving his basket on the beach, he walked up to the large gateway."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The pillars of the gate were made of beautiful red coral, and the gate itself was adorned with glittering gems of all kinds."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Large katsura trees overshadowed it.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Our hero had often heard of the wonders of the Sea King's Palace beneath the sea, but all the stories he had ever heard fell short of the reality which he now saw for the first time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter would have liked to enter the gate there and then, but he saw that it was fast closed, and also that there was no one about whom he could ask to open it for him, so he stopped to think what he should do."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,In the shade of the trees before the gate he noticed a well full of fresh spring water.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Surely some one would come out to draw water from the well some time, he thought."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Then he climbed into the tree overhanging the well, and seated himself to rest on one of the branches, and waited for what might happen."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Ere long he saw the huge gate swing open, and two beautiful women came out."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Now the Mikoto (Augustness) had always heard that Ryn Gu was the realm of the Dragon King under the Sea, and had naturally supposed that the place was inhabited by dragons and similar terrible creatures, so that when he saw these two lovely princesses, whose beauty would be rare even in the world from which he had just come, he was exceedingly surprised, and wondered what it could mean."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He said not a word, however, but silently gazed at them through the foliage of the trees, waiting to see what they would do."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He saw that in their hands they carried golden buckets.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Slowly and gracefully in their trailing garments they approached the well, standing in the shade of the katsura trees, and were about to draw water, all unknowing of the stranger who was watching them, for the Happy Hunter was quite hidden among the branches of the tree where he had posted himself."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"As the two ladies leaned over the side of the well to let down their golden buckets, which they did every day in the year, they saw reflected in the deep still water the face of a handsome youth gazing at them from amidst the branches of the tree in whose shade they stood."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Never before had they seen the face of mortal man; they were frightened, and drew back quickly with their golden buckets in their hands."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Their curiosity, however, soon gave them courage, and they glanced timidly upwards to see the cause of the unusual reflection, and then they beheld the Happy Hunter sitting in the tree looking down at them with surprise and admiration."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"They gazed at him face to face, but their tongues were still with wonder and could not find a word to say to him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"When the Mikoto saw that he was discovered, he sprang down lightly from the tree and said: ""I am a traveler, and as I was very thirsty I came to the well in the hopes of quenching my thirst, but I could find no bucket with which to draw the water. So I climbed into the tree, much vexed, and waited for some one to come. Just at that moment, while I was thirstily and impatiently waiting, you noble ladies appeared, as if in answer to my great need. Therefore I pray you of your mercy give me some water to drink, for I am a thirsty traveler in a strange land."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"His dignity and graciousness overruled their timidity, and bowing in silence they both once more approached the well, and letting down their golden buckets drew up some water and poured it into a jeweled cup and offered it to the stranger."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He received it from them with both hands, raising it to the height of his forehead in token of high respect and pleasure, and then drank the water quickly, for his thirst was great."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"When he had finished his long draught he set the cup down on the edge of the well, and drawing his short sword he cut off one of the strange curved jewels (magatama), a necklace of which hung round his neck and fell over his breast."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He placed the jewel in the cup and returned it to them, and said, bowing deeply: ""This is a token of my thanks!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The two ladies took the cup, and looking into it to see what he had put inside-for they did not yet know what it was-they gave a start of surprise, for there lay a beautiful gem at the bottom of the cup."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""No ordinary mortal would give away a jewel so freely. Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?"" said the elder damsel."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Certainly,"" said the Happy Hunter, ""I am Hohodemi, the fourth Mikoto, also called in Japan, the Happy Hunter."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Are you indeed Hohodemi, the grandson of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess?"" asked the damsel who had spoken first."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""I am the eldest daughter of Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea, and my name is Princess Tayotama."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""And,"" said the younger maiden, who at last found her tongue, ""I am her sister, the Princess Tamayori."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Are you indeed the daughters of Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea? I cannot tell you how glad I am to meet you,"" said the Happy Hunter."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"And without waiting for them to reply he went on: ""The other day I went fishing with my brother's hook and dropped it, how, I am sure I can't tell. As my brother prizes his fishing hook above all his other possessions, this is the greatest calamity that could have befallen me. Unless I find it again I can never hope to win my brother's forgiveness, for he is very angry at what I have done. I have searched for it many, many times, but I cannot find it, therefore I am much troubled. While I was hunting for the hook, in great distress, I met a wise old man, and he told me that the best thing I could do was to come to Ryn Gu, and to Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, and ask him to help me. This kind old man also showed me how to come. Now you know how it is I am here and why. I want to ask Ryn Jin, if he knows where the lost hook is. Will you be so kind as to take me to your father? And do you think he will see me?"" asked the Happy Hunter anxiously."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Princess Tayotama listened to this long story, and then said: ""Not only is it easy for you to see my father, but he will be much pleased to meet you. I am sure he will say that good fortune has befallen him, that so great and noble a man as you, the grandson of Amaterasu, should come down to the bottom of the sea."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"And then turning to her younger sister, she said: ""Do you not think so, Tamayori?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Yes, indeed,"" answered the Princess Tamayori, in her sweet voice."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""As you say, we can know no greater honor than to welcome the Mikoto to our home."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Then I ask you to be so kind as to lead the way,"" said the Happy Hunter."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Condescend to enter, Mikoto (Augustness),"" said both the sisters, and bowing low, they led him through the gate."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The younger Princess left her sister to take charge of the Happy Hunter, and going faster than they, she reached the Sea King's Palace first, and running quickly to her father's room, she told him of all that had happened to them at the gate, and that her sister was even now bringing the Augustness to him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Dragon King of the Sea was much surprised at the news, for it was but seldom, perhaps only once in several hundred years, that the Sea King's Palace was visited by mortals."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Ryn Jin at once clapped his hands and summoned all his courtiers and the servants of the Palace, and the chief fish of the sea together, and solemnly told them that the grandson of the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, was coming to the Palace, and that they must be very ceremonious and polite in serving the august visitor."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He then ordered them all to the entrance of the Palace to welcome the Happy Hunter.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Ryn Jin then dressed himself in his robes of ceremony, and went out to welcome him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"In a few moments the Princess Tayotama and the Happy Hunter reached the entrance, and the Sea King and his wife bowed to the ground and thanked him for the honor he did them in coming to see them."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Sea King then led the Happy Hunter to the guest room, and placing him in the uppermost seat, he bowed respectfully before him, and said: ""I am Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, and this is my wife. Condescend to remember us forever!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Are you indeed Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea, of whom I have so often heard?"" answered the Happy Hunter, saluting his host most ceremoniously."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""I must apologize for all the trouble I am giving you by my unexpected visit."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"And he bowed again, and thanked the Sea King."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""You need not thank me,"" said Ryn Jin."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""It is I who must thank you for coming. Although the Sea Palace is a poor place, as you see, I shall be highly honored if you will make us a long visit."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"There was much gladness between the Sea King and the Happy Hunter, and they sat and talked for a long time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"At last the Sea King clapped his hands, and then a huge retinue of fishes appeared, all robed in ceremonial garments, and bearing in their fins various trays on which all kinds of sea delicacies were served."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,A great feast was now spread before the King and his Royal guest.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"All the fishes-in-waiting were chosen from amongst the finest fish in the sea, so you can imagine what a wonderful array of sea creatures it was that waited upon the Happy Hunter that day."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,All in the Palace tried to do their best to please him and to show him that he was a much honored guest.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"During the long repast, which lasted for hours, Ryn Jin commanded his daughters to play some music, and the two Princesses came in and performed on the KOTO (the Japanese harp), and sang and danced in turns."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The time passed so pleasantly that the Happy Hunter seemed to forget his trouble and why he had come at all to the Sea King's Realm, and he gave himself up to the enjoyment of this wonderful place, the land of fairy fishes!"
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Who has ever heard of such a marvelous place?
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"But the Mikoto soon remembered what had brought him to Ryn Gu, and said to his host:"
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Perhaps your daughters have told you, King Ryn Jin, that I have come here to try and recover my brother's fishing hook, which I lost while fishing the other day. May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Certainly,"" said the obliging Sea King, ""I will immediately summon them all here and ask them."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"As soon as he had issued his command, the octopus, the cuttlefish, the bonito, the oxtail fish, the eel, the jelly fish, the shrimp, and the plaice, and many other fishes of all kinds came in and sat down before Ryn Jin their King, and arranged themselves and their fins in order."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Then the Sea King said solemnly: ""Our visitor who is sitting before you all is the august grandson of Amaterasu. His name is Hohodemi, the fourth Augustness, and he is also called the Happy Hunter of the Mountains. While he was fishing the other day upon the shore of Japan, some one robbed him of his brother's fishing hook. He has come all this way down to the bottom of the sea to our Kingdom because he thought that one of you fishes may have taken the hook from him in mischievous play. If any of you have done so you must immediately return it, or if any of you know who the thief is you must at once tell us his name and where he is now."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"All the fishes were taken by surprise when they heard these words, and could say nothing for some time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,They sat looking at each other and at the Dragon King.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"At last the cuttlefish came forward and said: ""I think the TAI (the red bream) must be the thief who has stolen the hook!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Where is your proof?"" asked the King."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Since yesterday evening the TAI has not been able to eat anything, and he seems to be suffering from a bad throat! For this reason I think the hook may be in his throat. You had better send for him at once!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"All the fish agreed to this, and said: ""It is certainly strange that the TAI is the only fish who has not obeyed your summons. Will you send for him and inquire into the matter. Then our innocence will be proved."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Yes,"" said the Sea King, ""it is strange that the TAI has not come, for he ought to be the first to be here. Send for him at once!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Without waiting for the King's order the cuttlefish had already started for the TAI'S dwelling, and he now returned, bringing the TAI with him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He led him before the King.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,The TAI sat there looking frightened and ill.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He certainly was in pain, for his usually red face was pale, and his eyes were nearly closed and looked but half their usual size."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Answer, O TAI!"" cried the Sea King, ""why did you not come in answer to my summons today?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""I have been ill since yesterday,"" answered the TAI; ""that is why I could not come."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Don't say another word!"" cried out Ryn Jin angrily."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""Your illness is the punishment of the gods for stealing the Mikoto's hook."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""It is only too true!"" said the TAI; ""the hook is still in my throat, and all my efforts to get it out have been useless. I can't eat, and I can scarcely breathe, and each moment I feel that it will choke me, and sometimes it gives me great pain. I had no intention of stealing the Mikoto's hook. I heedlessly snapped at the bait which I saw in the water, and the hook came off and stuck in my throat. So I hope you will pardon me."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The cuttlefish now came forward, and said to the King: ""What I said was right. You see the hook still sticks in the TAI'S throat. I hope to be able to pull it out in the presence of the Mikoto, and then we can return it to him safely!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""O please make haste and pull it out!"" cried the TAI, pitifully, for he felt the pains in his throat coming on again; ""I do so want to return the hook to the Mikoto."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""All right, TAI SAN,"" said his friend the cuttlefish, and then opening the TAI'S mouth as wide as he could and putting one of his feelers down the TAI'S throat, he quickly and easily drew the hook out of the sufferer's large mouth."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He then washed it and brought it to the King.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Ryn Jin took the hook from his subject, and then respectfully returned it to the Happy Hunter (the Mikoto or Augustness, the fishes called him), who was overjoyed at getting back his hook."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He thanked Ryn Jin many times, his face beaming with gratitude, and said that he owed the happy ending of his quest to the Sea King's wise authority and kindness."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Ryn Jin now desired to punish the TAI, but the Happy Hunter begged him not to do so; since his lost hook was thus happily recovered he did not wish to make more trouble for the poor TAI."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"It was indeed the TAI who had taken the hook, but he had already suffered enough for his fault, if fault it could be called."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter said he blamed himself; if he had understood how to fish properly he would never have lost his hook, and therefore all this trouble had been caused in the first place by his trying to do something which he did not know how to do."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,So he begged the Sea King to forgive his subject.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge?
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Ryn Jin forgave his subject at once at the request of his august guest.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The TAI was so glad that he shook his fins for joy, and he and all the other fish went out from the presence of their King, praising the virtues of the Happy Hunter."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Now that the hook was found the Happy Hunter had nothing to keep him in Ryn Gu, and he was anxious to get back to his own kingdom and to make peace with his angry brother, the Skillful Fisher; but the Sea King, who had learnt to love him and would fain have kept him as a son, begged him not to go so soon, but to make the Sea Palace his home as long as ever he liked."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"While the Happy Hunter was still hesitating, the two lovely Princesses, Tayotama and Tamayori, came, and with the sweetest of bows and voices joined with their father in pressing him to stay, so that without seeming ungracious he could not say them ""Nay,"" and was obliged to stay on for some time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Between the Sea Realm and the Earth there was no difference in the night of time, and the Happy Hunter found that three years went fleeting quickly by in this delightful land."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,The years pass swiftly when any one is truly happy.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"But though the wonders of that enchanted land seemed to be new every day, and though the Sea King's kindness seemed rather to increase than to grow less with time, the Happy Hunter grew more and more homesick as the days passed, and he could not repress a great anxiety to know what had happened to his home and his country and his brother while he had been away."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"So at last he went to the Sea King and said: ""My stay with you here has been most happy and I am very grateful to you for all your kindness to me, but I govern Japan, and, delightful as this place is, I cannot absent myself forever from my country. I must also return the fishing hook to my brother and ask his forgiveness for having deprived him of it for so long. I am indeed very sorry to part from you, but this time it cannot be helped. With your gracious permission, I will take my leave to-day. I hope to make you another visit some day. Please give up the idea of my staying longer now."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"King Ryn Jin was overcome with sorrow at the thought that he must lose his friend who had made a great diversion in the Palace of the Sea, and his tears fell fast as he answered: ""We are indeed very sorry to part with you, Mikoto, for we have enjoyed your stay with us very much. You have been a noble and honored guest and we have heartily made you welcome. I quite understand that as you govern Japan you ought to be there and not here, and that it is vain for us to try and keep you longer with us, much as we would like to have you stay. I hope you will not forget us. Strange circumstances have brought us together and I trust the friendship thus begun between the Land and the Sea will last and grow stronger than it has ever been before."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,When the Sea King had finished speaking he turned to his two daughters and bade them bring him the two Tide-Jewels of the Sea.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The two Princesses bowed low, rose and glided out of the hall."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"In a few minutes they returned, each one carrying in her hands a flashing gem which filled the room with light."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,As the Happy Hunter looked at them he wondered what they could be.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Sea King took them from his daughters and said to his guest: ""These two valuable talismans we have inherited from our ancestors from time immemorial. We now give them to you as a parting gift in token of our great affection for you. These two gems are called the nanjiu and the kanjiu."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter bowed low to the ground and said: ""I can never thank you enough for all your kindness to me. And now will you add one more favor to the rest and tell me what these jewels are and what I am to do with them?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"""The nanjiu,"" answered the Sea King, ""is also called the Jewel of the Flood Tide, and whoever holds it in his possession can command the sea to roll in and to flood the land at any time that he wills. The kanjiu is also called the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide, and this gem controls the sea and the waves thereof, and will cause even a tidal wave to recede."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Then Ryn Jin showed his friend how to use the talismans one by one and handed them to him.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter was very glad to have these two wonderful gems, the Jewel of the Flood Tide and the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide, to take back with him, for he felt that they would preserve him in case of danger from enemies at any time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"After thanking his kind host again and again, he prepared to depart."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Sea King and the two Princesses, Tayotama and Tamayori, and all the inmates of the Palace, came out to say ""Good-by,"" and before the sound of the last farewell had died away the Happy Hunter passed out from under the gateway, past the well of happy memory standing in the shade of the great KATSURA trees on his way to the beach."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Here he found, instead of the queer basket on which he had come to the Realm of Ryn Gu, a large crocodile waiting for him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Never had he seen such a huge creature.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,It measured eight fathoms in length from the tip of its tail to the end of its long mouth.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,The Sea King had ordered the monster to carry the Happy Hunter back to Japan.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Like the wonderful basket which Shiwozuchino Okina had made, it could travel faster than any steamboat, and in this strange way, riding on the back of a crocodile, the Happy Hunter returned to his own land."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"As soon as the crocodile landed him, the Happy Hunter hastened to tell the Skillful Fisher of his safe return."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He then gave him back the fishing hook which had been found in the mouth of the TAI and which had been the cause of so much trouble between them.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He earnestly begged his brother's forgiveness, telling him all that had happened to him in the Sea King's Palace and what wonderful adventures had led to the finding of the hook."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Now the Skillful Fisher had used the lost hook as an excuse for driving his brother out of the country.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"When his brother had left him that day three years ago, and had not returned, he had been very glad in his evil heart and had at once usurped his brother's place as ruler of the land, and had become powerful and rich."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Now in the midst of enjoying what did not belong to him, and hoping that his brother might never return to claim his rights, quite unexpectedly there stood the Happy Hunter before him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Skillful Fisher feigned forgiveness, for he could make no more excuses for sending his brother away again, but in his heart he was very angry and hated his brother more and more, till at last he could no longer bear the sight of him day after day, and planned and watched for an opportunity to kill him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,One day when the Happy Hunter was walking in the rice fields his brother followed him with a dagger.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter knew that his brother was following him to kill him, and he felt that now, in this hour of great danger, was the time to use the Jewels of the Flow and Ebb of the Tide and prove whether what the Sea King had told him was true or not."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,So he took out the Jewel of the Flood Tide from the bosom of his dress and raised it to his forehead.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Instantly over the fields and over the farms the sea came rolling in wave upon wave till it reached the spot where his brother was standing.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,The Skillful Fisher stood amazed and terrified to see what was happening.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,In another minute he was struggling in the water and calling on his brother to save him from drowning.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,The Happy Hunter had a kind heart and could not bear the sight of his brother's distress.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,He at once put back the Jewel of the Flood Tide and took out the Jewel of the Ebb Tide.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"No sooner did he hold it up as high as his forehead than the sea ran back and back, and ere long the tossing rolling floods had vanished, and the farms and fields and dry land appeared as before."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Skillful Fisher was very frightened at the peril of death in which he had stood, and was greatly impressed by the wonderful things he had seen his brother do."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"He learned now that he was making a fatal mistake to set himself against his brother, younger than he thought he was, for he now had become so powerful that the sea would flow in and the tide ebb at his word of command."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,So he humbled himself before the Happy Hunter and asked him to forgive him all the wrong he had done him.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Skillful Fisher promised to restore his brother to his rights and also swore that though the Happy Hunter was the younger brother and owed him allegiance by right of birth, that he, the Skillful Fisher, would exalt him as his superior and bow before him as Lord of all Japan."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,Then the Happy Hunter said that he would forgive his brother if he would throw into the receding tide all his evil ways.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,The Skillful Fisher promised and there was peace between the two brothers.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,From this time he kept his word and became a good man and a kind brother.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"The Happy Hunter now ruled his Kingdom without being disturbed by family strife, and there was peace in Japan for a long, long time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,"Above all the treasures in his house he prized the wonderful Jewels of the Flow and Ebb of the Tide which had been given him by Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,This is the congratulatory ending of the Happy Hunter and the Skillful Fisher.
enchanted-wreath,"Once upon a time there lived near a forest a man and his wife and two girls; one girl was the daughter of the man, and the other the daughter of his wife; and the man's daughter was good and beautiful, but the woman's daughter was cross and ugly."
enchanted-wreath,"However, her mother did not know that, but thought her the most bewitching maiden that ever was seen."
enchanted-wreath,One day the man called to his daughter and bade her come with him into the forest to cut wood.
enchanted-wreath,"They worked hard all day, but in spite of the chopping they were very cold, for it rained heavily, and when they returned home, they were wet through."
enchanted-wreath,"Then, to his vexation, the man found that he had left his axe behind him, and he knew that if it lay all night in the mud it would become rusty and useless."
enchanted-wreath,"So he said to his wife: 'I have dropped my axe in the forest, bid your daughter go and fetch it, for mine has worked hard all day and is both wet and weary.'"
enchanted-wreath,"But the wife answered: 'If your daughter is wet already, it is all the more reason that she should go and get the axe. Besides, she is a great strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.'"
enchanted-wreath,"By long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more, and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe."
enchanted-wreath,"The walk took some time, for it was very dark, and her shoes often stuck in the mud, but she was brave as well as beautiful and never thought of turning back merely because the path was both difficult and unpleasant."
enchanted-wreath,"At last, with her dress torn by brambles that she could not see, and her fact scratched by the twigs on the trees, she reached the spot where she and her father had been cutting in the morning, and found the axe in the place he had left it."
enchanted-wreath,"To her surprise, three little doves were sitting on the handle, all of them looking very sad."
enchanted-wreath,"'You poor little things,' said the girl, stroking them."
enchanted-wreath,"'Why do you sit there and get wet? Go and fly home to your nest, it will be much warmer than this; but first eat this bread, which I saved from my dinner, and perhaps you will feel happier. It is my father's axe you are sitting on, and I must take it back as fast as I can, or I shall get a terrible scolding from my stepmother.'"
enchanted-wreath,"She then crumbled the bread on the ground, and was pleased to see the doves flutter quite cheerfully towards it. ' Good-bye,' she said, picking up the axe, and went her way homewards."
enchanted-wreath,"By the time they had finished all the crumbs the doves felt must better, and were able to fly back to their nest in the top of a tree."
enchanted-wreath,"'That is a good girl,' said one; 'I really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came. I should like to do something to show how grateful I am.' ' Well, let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it,' cried another. ' And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers,' rejoined the third. ' Yes, that will do beautifully,' said the first."
enchanted-wreath,"And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen."
enchanted-wreath,"The father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy."
enchanted-wreath,"'How absurd to walk about on such a pouring night, dressed up like that,' she remarked crossly, and roughly pulled off the wreath as she spoke, to place it on her own daughter."
enchanted-wreath,"As she did so the roses became withered and brown, and the birds flew out of the window."
enchanted-wreath,"'See what a trumpery thing it is!' cried the stepmother; 'and now take your supper and go to bed, for it is near upon midnight.'"
enchanted-wreath,"But though she pretended to despise the wreath, she longed none the less for her daughter to have one like it."
enchanted-wreath,"Now it happened that the next evening the father, who had been alone in the forest, came back a second time without his axe."
enchanted-wreath,"The stepmother's heart was glad when she saw this, and she said quite mildly: 'Why, you have forgotten your axe again, you careless man! But now your daughter shall stay at home, and mine shall go and bring it back'; and throwing a cloak over the girl's shoulders, she bade her hasten to the forest."
enchanted-wreath,"With a very ill grace the damsel set forth, grumbling to herself as she went; for though she wished for the wreath, she did not at all want the trouble of getting it."
enchanted-wreath,"By the time she reached the spot where her stepfather had been cutting the wood the girl was in a very bad temper indeed, and when she caught sight of the axe, there were the three little doves, with drooping heads and soiled, bedraggled feathers, sitting on the handle."
enchanted-wreath,"' You dirty creatures,' cried she, 'get away at once, or I will throw stones at you!'"
enchanted-wreath,"And the doves spread their wings in a fright and flew up to the very top of a tree, their bodies shaking with anger."
enchanted-wreath,"'What shall we do to revenge ourselves on her?' asked the smallest of the doves, 'we were never treated like that before.'"
enchanted-wreath,"'Never,' said the biggest dove."
enchanted-wreath,'We must find some way of paying her back in her own coin!'
enchanted-wreath,"'I know,' answered the middle dove; 'she shall never be able to say anything but ""dirty creatures"" to the end of her life.'"
enchanted-wreath,"'Oh, how clever of you! That will do beautifully,' exclaimed the other two."
enchanted-wreath,"And they flapped their wings and clucked so loud with delight, and made such a noise, that they woke up all the birds in the trees close by."
enchanted-wreath,'What in the world is the matter?' asked the birds sleepily.
enchanted-wreath,"'That is our secret,' said the doves."
enchanted-wreath,Meanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures.
enchanted-wreath,"'Well, did you get the wreath?' cried she."
enchanted-wreath,'Dirty creatures!' answered her daughter. ' Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?' asked the mother again.
enchanted-wreath,"'Dirty creatures!' repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say."
enchanted-wreath,"Then the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter."
enchanted-wreath,"'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing."
enchanted-wreath,"If the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head."
enchanted-wreath,"Things went on like this for some weeks, when, one day, as the king's son was riding through the forest, he heard some strange birds singing more sweetly than birds had ever sung before."
enchanted-wreath,"He tied his horse to a tree, and followed where the sound led him, and, to his surprise, he saw before him a beautiful girl chopping wood, with a wreath of pink rose-buds, out of which the singing came."
enchanted-wreath,"Standing in the shelter of a tree, he watched her a long while, and then, hat in hand, he went up and spoke to her."
enchanted-wreath,"'Fair maiden, who are you, and who gave you that wreath of singing roses?' asked he, for the birds were so tiny that till you looked closely you never saw them."
enchanted-wreath,"'I live in a hut on the edge of the forest,' she answered, blushing, for she had never spoken to a prince before."
enchanted-wreath,"'As to the wreath, I know not how it came there, unless it may be the gift of some doves whom I fed when they were starving!'"
enchanted-wreath,"The prince was delighted with this answer, which showed the goodness of the girl's heart, and besides he had fallen in love with her beauty, and would not be content till she promised to return with him to the palace, and become his bride."
enchanted-wreath,"The old king was naturally disappointed at his son's choice of a wife, as he wished him to marry a neighbouring princess; but as from his birth the prince had always done exactly as he like, nothing was said and a splendid wedding feast was got ready."
enchanted-wreath,"The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her."
enchanted-wreath,"As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen."
enchanted-wreath,"At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm."
enchanted-wreath,Her plan was this.
enchanted-wreath,"In the town where she had lived before she was married there was an old witch, who had more skill in magic that any other witch she knew."
enchanted-wreath,"To this witch she would go and beg her to make her a mask with the face of her stepdaughter, and when she had the mask the rest would be easy."
enchanted-wreath,"She told her daughter what she meant to do, and although the daughter could only say 'dirty creatures,' in answer, she nodded and smiled and looked well pleased."
enchanted-wreath,Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped.
enchanted-wreath,"By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference."
enchanted-wreath,"However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil."
enchanted-wreath,"The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak."
enchanted-wreath,"In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day."
enchanted-wreath,"This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before."
enchanted-wreath,"The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them."
enchanted-wreath,"At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom."
enchanted-wreath,"Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head."
enchanted-wreath,"'Rest your cheek on your hand, as if you were in pain, when the prince returns,' said the mother; 'and be careful not to speak, whatever you do. I will go back to the witch and see if she cannot take off the spell laid on you by those horrible birds. Ah! why did I not think of it before!'"
enchanted-wreath,"No sooner had the prince entered the palace than he hastened to the princess's apartments, where he found her lying on the sofa apparently in great pain."
enchanted-wreath,"' My dearest wife, what is the matter with you?' he cried, kneeling down beside her, and trying to take her hand; but she snatched it away, and pointing to her cheek murmured something he could not catch."
enchanted-wreath,"'What is it? tell me! Is the pain bad? When did it begin? Shall I send for your ladies to bath the place?' asked the prince, pouring out these and a dozen other questions, to which the girl only shook her head. ' But I can't leave you like this,' he continued, starting up, 'I must summon all the court physicians to apply soothing balsams to the sore place!'"
enchanted-wreath,"And as he spoke he sprang to his feet to go in search of them once came near her the trick would at once be discovered, that she forgot her mother's counsel not to speak, and forgot even the spell that had been laid upon her, and catching hold of the prince's tunic, she cried in tones of entreaty: 'Dirty creatures!'"
enchanted-wreath,"The young man stopped, not able to believe his ears, but supposed that pain had made the princess cross, as it sometimes does."
enchanted-wreath,"However, he guessed somehow that she wised to be left alone, so he only said: 'Well, I dare say a little sleep will do you good, if you can manage to get it, and that you will wake up better to-morrow.'"
enchanted-wreath,"Now, that night happened to be very hot and airless, and the prince, after vainly trying to rest, at length got up and went to the window."
enchanted-wreath,"Suddenly he beheld in the moonlight a form with a wreath of roses on her head rise out of the sea below him and step on to the sands, holding out her arms as she did so towards the palace."
enchanted-wreath,"'That maiden is strangely like my wife,' thought he; 'I must see her closer! And he hastened down to the water. But when he got there, the princess, for she indeed it was, had disappeared completely, and he began to wonder if his eyes had deceived him.'"
enchanted-wreath,"The next morning he went to the false bride's room, but her ladies told him she would neither speak nor get up, though she ate everything they set before her."
enchanted-wreath,"The prince was sorely perplexed as to what could be the matter with her, for naturally he could not guess that she was expecting her mother to return every moment, and to remove the spell the doves had laid upon her, and meanwhile was afraid to speak lest she should betray herself."
enchanted-wreath,"At length he made up his mind to summon all the court physicians; he did not tell her what he was going to do, lest it should make her worse, but he went himself and begged the four learned leeches attached to the king's person to follow him to the princess's apartments."
enchanted-wreath,"Unfortunately, as they entered, the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves, and shrieked out: 'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once, and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain."
enchanted-wreath,"He then tried to persuade his wife to send them a message that she was sorry for her rudeness, but not a word would she say."
enchanted-wreath,"Late that evening, when he had performed all the tiresome duties which fall to the lot of every prince, the young man was leaning out of his window, refreshing himself with the cool breezes that blew off the sea."
enchanted-wreath,"His thoughts went back to the scene of the morning, and he wondered if, after all, he had not made a great mistake in marrying a low-born wife, however beautiful she might be."
enchanted-wreath,"How could he have imagined that the quiet, gentle girl who had been so charming a companion to him during the first days of their marriage, could have become in a day the rude, sulky woman, who could not control her temper even to benefit herself."
enchanted-wreath,"One thing was clear, if she did not change her conduct very shortly he would have to send her away from court."
enchanted-wreath,"He was thinking these thoughts, when his eyes fell on the sea beneath him, and there, as before, was the figure that so closely resembled his wife, standing with her feet in the water, holding out her arms to him."
enchanted-wreath,'Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me!'
enchanted-wreath,he cried; not even knowing he was speaking.
enchanted-wreath,But when he reached the shore there was nothing to be seen but the shadows cast by the moonlight.
enchanted-wreath,"A state ceremonial in a city some distance off caused the prince to ride away at daybreak, and he left without seeing his wife again."
enchanted-wreath,"' Perhaps she may have come to her senses by to-morrow,' said he to himself; 'and, anyhow, if I am going to send her back to her father, it might be better if we did not meet in the meantime! Then he put the matter from his mind, and kept his thoughts on the duty that lay before him.'"
enchanted-wreath,"It was nearly midnight before he returned to the palace, but, instead of entering, he went down to the shore and hid behind a rock."
enchanted-wreath,"He had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea, and stretched out her arms towards his window."
enchanted-wreath,"In an instant the prince had seized her hand, and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water-for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her-he held her fast."
enchanted-wreath,"'You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,' he said."
enchanted-wreath,But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw.
enchanted-wreath,"Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake."
enchanted-wreath,"This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy."
enchanted-wreath,"The very next morning the stepmother arrived at the palace with an ointment that the old witch had given her to place upon her daughter's tongue, which would break the dove's spell, if the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea; if not, then it would be useless."
enchanted-wreath,"The mother assured her that she had seen her stepdaughter sink, and that there was no fear that she would ever come up again; but, to make all quite safe, the old woman might bewitch the girl; and so she did."
enchanted-wreath,"After that the wicked stepmother travelled all through the night to get to the palace as soon as possible, and made her way straight into her daughter's room."
enchanted-wreath,'I have got it! I have got it!'
enchanted-wreath,"she cried triumphantly, and laid the ointment on her daughter's tongue."
enchanted-wreath,'Now what do you say?'
enchanted-wreath,she asked proudly.
enchanted-wreath,"'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' answered the daughter; and the mother wrung her hands and wept, as she knew that all her plans had failed."
enchanted-wreath,At this moment the prince entered with his real wife.
enchanted-wreath,"'You both deserved death,' he said, 'and if it were left to me, you should have it. But the princess has begged me to spare your lives, so you will be put into a ship and carried off to a desert island, where you will stay till you die.'"
enchanted-wreath,"Then the ship was made ready and the wicked woman and her daughter were placed in it, and it sailed away, and no more was heard of them."
enchanted-wreath,"But the prince and his wife lived together long and happily, and ruled their people well."
the-sea-king-gift,"There was once a fisherman who was called Salmon, and his Christian name was Matte."
the-sea-king-gift,He lived by the shore of the big sea; where else could he live?
the-sea-king-gift,He had a wife called Maie; could you find a better name for her?
the-sea-king-gift,"In winter they dwelt in a little cottage by the shore, but in spring they flitted to a red rock out in the sea and stayed there the whole summer until it was autumn."
the-sea-king-gift,"The cottage on the rock was even smaller than the other; it had a wooden bolt instead of an iron lock to the door, a stone hearth, a flagstaff, and a weather-cock on the roof."
the-sea-king-gift,"The rock was called Ahtola, and was not larger than the market-place of a town."
the-sea-king-gift,Between the crevices there grew a little rowan tree and four alder bushes.
the-sea-king-gift,Heaven only knows how they ever came there; perhaps they were brought by the winter storms.
the-sea-king-gift,"Besides that, there flourished some tufts of velvety grass, some scattered reeds, two plants of the yellow herb called tansy, four of a red flower, and a pretty white one; but the treasures of the rock consisted of three roots of garlic, which Maie had put in a cleft."
the-sea-king-gift,"Rock walls sheltered them on the north side, and the sun shone on them on the south."
the-sea-king-gift,"This does not seem much, but it sufficed Maie for a herb plot."
the-sea-king-gift,"All good things go in threes, so Matte and his wife fished for salmon in spring, for herring in summer, and for cod in winter."
the-sea-king-gift,"When on Saturdays the weather was fine and the wind favourable, they sailed to the nearest town, sold their fish, and went to church on Sunday."
the-sea-king-gift,"But it often happened that for weeks at a time they were quite alone on the rock Ahtola, and had nothing to look at except their little yellow-brown dog, which bore the grand name of Prince, their grass tufts, their bushes and blooms, the sea bays and fish, a stormy sky and the blue, white-crested waves."
the-sea-king-gift,"For the rock lay far away from the land, and there were no green islets or human habitations for miles round, only here and there appeared a rock of the same red stone as Ahtola, besprinkled day and night with the ocean spray."
the-sea-king-gift,"Matte and Maie were industrious, hard-working folk, happy and contented in their poor hut, and they thought themselves rich when they were able to salt as many casks of fish as they required for winter and yet have some left over with which to buy tobacco for the old man, and a pound or two of coffee for his wife, with plenty of burned corn and chicory in it to give it a flavour."
the-sea-king-gift,"Besides that, they had bread, butter, fish, a beer cask, and a buttermilk jar; what more did they require?"
the-sea-king-gift,"All would have gone well had not Maie been possessed with a secret longing which never let her rest; and this was, how she could manage to become the owner of a cow."
the-sea-king-gift,'What would you do with a cow?' asked Matte.
the-sea-king-gift,"'She could not swim so far, and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here; and even if we had her, we have nothing to feed her on.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'We have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass,' rejoined Maie. ' Yes, of course,' laughed Matte, 'and we have also three plants of garlic. Garlic would be fine feeding for her.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Every cow likes salt herring,' rejoined his wife. ' Even Prince is fond of fish.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'That may be,' said her husband. ' Methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring. All very well for Prince, who fights with the gulls over the last morsel. Put the cow out of your head, mother, we are very well off as we are.'"
the-sea-king-gift,Maie sighed.
the-sea-king-gift,"She knew well that her husband was right, but she could not give up the idea of a cow."
the-sea-king-gift,"The buttermilk no longer tasted as good as usual in the coffee; she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter, and of how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them."
the-sea-king-gift,"One day as Matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they heard Prince barking, and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with three young men in it, steering towards the rock."
the-sea-king-gift,"They were students, on a boating excursion, and wanted to get something to eat."
the-sea-king-gift,"'Bring us a junket, good mother,' cried they to Maie. ' Ah! if only I had such a thing!' sighed Maie. ' A can of fresh milk, then,' said the students; 'but it must not be skim.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Yes, if only I had it!' sighed the old woman, still more deeply."
the-sea-king-gift,' What! haven't you got a cow?'
the-sea-king-gift,Maie was silent.
the-sea-king-gift,This question so struck her to the heart that she could not reply.
the-sea-king-gift,"'We have no cow,' Matte answered; 'but we have good smoked herring, and can cook them in a couple of hours.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'All right, then, that will do,' said the students, as they flung themselves down on the rock, while fifty silvery-white herring were turning on the spit in front of the fire."
the-sea-king-gift,'What's the name of this little stone in the middle of the ocean?' asked one of them.
the-sea-king-gift,"'Ahtola,' answered the old man. ' Well, you should want for nothing when you live in the Sea King's dominion.'"
the-sea-king-gift,Matte did not understand.
the-sea-king-gift,"He had never read Kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old, but the students proceeded to explain to him. ' Ahti,' said they, 'is a mighty king who lives in his dominion of Ahtola, and has a rock at the bottom of the sea, and possesses besides a treasury of good things. He rules over all fish and animals of the deep; he has the finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grass at the bottom of the ocean. He who stands well with Ahti is soon a rich man, but one must beware in dealing with him, for he is very changeful and touchy. Even a little stone thrown into the water might offend him, and then as he takes back his gift, he stirs up the sea into a storm and drags the sailors down into the depths. Ahti owns also the fairest maidens, who bear the train of his queen Wellamos, and at the sound of music they comb their long, flowing locks, which glisten in the water.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Oh!' cried Matte, 'have your worships really seen all that?'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'We have as good as seen it,' said the students."
the-sea-king-gift,"'It is all printed in a book, and everything printed is true.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'I'm not so sure of that,' said Matte, as he shook his head."
the-sea-king-gift,"But the herring were now ready, and the students ate enough for six, and gave Prince some cold meat which they happened to have in the boat."
the-sea-king-gift,Prince sat on his hind legs with delight and mewed like a pussy cat.
the-sea-king-gift,"When all was finished, the students handed Matte a shining silver coin, and allowed him to fill his pipe with a special kind of tobacco."
the-sea-king-gift,"They then thanked him for his kind hospitality and went on their journey, much regretted by Prince, who sat with a woeful expression and whined on the shore as long as he could see a flip of the boat's white sail in the distance."
the-sea-king-gift,"Maie had never uttered a word, but thought the more."
the-sea-king-gift,"She had good ears, and had laid to heart the story about Ahti."
the-sea-king-gift,"'How delightful,' thought she to herself, 'to possess a fairy cow! How delicious every morning and evening to draw milk from it, and yet have no trouble about the feeding, and to keep a shelf near the window for dishes of milk and junkets! But this will never be my luck.'"
the-sea-king-gift,'What are you thinking of?' asked Matte.
the-sea-king-gift,"' Nothing,' said his wife; but all the time she was pondering over some magic rhymes she had heard in her childhood from an old lame man, which were supposed to bring luck in fishing."
the-sea-king-gift,' What if I were to try?' thought she.
the-sea-king-gift,"Now this was Saturday, and on Saturday evenings Matte never set the herring-net, for he did not fish on Sunday."
the-sea-king-gift,"Towards evening, however, his wife said: 'Let us set the herring-net just this once.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'No,' said her husband, 'it is a Saturday night.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Last night was so stormy, and we caught so little,' urged his wife; 'to-night the sea is like a mirror, and with the wind in this direction the herring are drawing towards land.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"' But there are streaks in the north-western sky, and Prince was eating grass this evening,' said the old man."
the-sea-king-gift,"' Surely he has not eaten my garlic,' exclaimed the old woman."
the-sea-king-gift,"' No; but there will be rough weather by to-morrow at sunset,' rejoined Matte."
the-sea-king-gift,"'Listen to me,' said his wife, 'we will set only one net close to the shore, and then we shall be able to finish up our half-filled cask, which will spoil if it stands open so long.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"The old man allowed himself to be talked over, and so they rowed out with the net."
the-sea-king-gift,"When they reached the deepest part of the water, she began to hum the words of the magic rhyme, altering the words to suit the longing of her heart:"
the-sea-king-gift,"Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard, Who dwellest in the deep blue sea, Finest treasures have I heard, And glittering fish belong to thee."
the-sea-king-gift,"The richest pearls beyond compare, Are stored up in thy realm below, And Ocean's cows so sleek and fair, Feed on the grass in thy green meadow."
the-sea-king-gift,"King of the waters, far and near, I ask not of thy golden store, I wish not jewels of pearl to wear, Nor silver either, ask I for, But one is odd and even is two, So give me a cow, sea-king so bold, And in return I'll give to you, A slice of the moon, and the sun's gold."
the-sea-king-gift,' What's that you're humming?' asked the old man.
the-sea-king-gift,"'Oh, only the words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,' answered the old woman; and she raised her voice and went on: Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard, Who dwellest in the deep blue sea, A thousand cows are in thy herd, I pray thee give one onto me."
the-sea-king-gift,"'That's a stupid sort of song,' said Matte."
the-sea-king-gift,' What else should one beg of the sea-king but fish? But such songs are not for Sunday.'
the-sea-king-gift,"His wife pretended not to hear him, and sang and sang the same tune all the time they were on the water."
the-sea-king-gift,"Matte heard nothing more as he sat and rowed the heavy boat, while thinking of his cracked pipe and the fine tobacco."
the-sea-king-gift,"Then they returned to the island, and soon after went to bed."
the-sea-king-gift,"But neither Matte nor Maie could sleep a wink; the one thought of how he had profaned Sunday, and the other of Ahti's cow."
the-sea-king-gift,"About midnight the fisherman sat up, and said to his wife: 'Dost thou hear anything?' ' No,' said she."
the-sea-king-gift,"'I think the twirling of the weathercock on the roof bodes ill,' said he; 'we shall have a storm.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Oh, it is nothing but your fancy,' said his wife."
the-sea-king-gift,"Matte lay down, but soon rose again."
the-sea-king-gift,"' The weathercock is squeaking now,' said he. ' Just fancy! Go to sleep,' said his wife; and the old man tried to."
the-sea-king-gift,For the third time he jumped out of bed.
the-sea-king-gift,"'Ho! how the weather-cock is roaring at the pitch of its voice, as if it had a fire inside it! We are going to have a tempest, and must bring in the net.'"
the-sea-king-gift,Both rose.
the-sea-king-gift,"The summer night was as dark as if it had been October, the weather-cock creaked, and the storm was raging in every direction."
the-sea-king-gift,"As they went out the sea lay around them as white as now, and the spray was dashing right over the fisher-hut."
the-sea-king-gift,In all his life Matte had never remembered such a night.
the-sea-king-gift,To launch the boat and put to sea to rescue the net was a thing not to be thought of.
the-sea-king-gift,"The fisherman and his wife stood aghast on the doorstep, holding on fast by the doorpost, while the foam splashed over their faces."
the-sea-king-gift,'Did I not tell thee that there is no luck in Sunday fishing?' said Matte sulkily; and his wife was so frightened that she never even once thought of Ahti's cows.
the-sea-king-gift,"As there was nothing to be done, they went in."
the-sea-king-gift,"Their eyes were heavy for lack of slumber, and they slept as soundly as if there had not been such a thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling."
the-sea-king-gift,"When they awoke, the sun was high in the heavens, the tempest had cased, and only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the red rock."
the-sea-king-gift,"'What can that be?' said the old woman, as she peeped out of the door."
the-sea-king-gift,"'It looks like a big seal,' said Matte."
the-sea-king-gift,"'As sure as I live, it's a cow!' exclaimed Maie."
the-sea-king-gift,"And certainly it was a cow, a fine red cow, fat and flourishing, and looking as if it had been fed all its days on spinach."
the-sea-king-gift,"It wandered peacefully up and down the shore, and never so much as even looked at the poor little tufts of grass, as if it despised such fare."
the-sea-king-gift,Matte could not believe his eyes.
the-sea-king-gift,"But a cow she seemed, and a cow she was found to be; and when the old woman began to milk her, every pitcher and pan, even to the baler, was soon filled with the most delicious milk."
the-sea-king-gift,"The old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there, and sallied forth to seek for his lost net."
the-sea-king-gift,"He had not proceeded far when he found it cast up on the shore, and so full of fish that not a mesh was visible."
the-sea-king-gift,"'It is all very fine to possess a cow,' said Matte, as he cleaned the fish; 'but what are we going to feed her on?'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'We shall find some means,' said his wife; and the cow found the means herself."
the-sea-king-gift,"She went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great abundance near the shore, and always kept in good condition."
the-sea-king-gift,"Every one Prince alone excepted, thought she was a clever beast; but Prince barked at her, for he had now got a rival."
the-sea-king-gift,"From that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets, and every net was filled with fish."
the-sea-king-gift,"Matte and Maie grew fat on this fine living, and daily became richer."
the-sea-king-gift,"She churned quantities of butter, and he hired two men to help him in his fishing."
the-sea-king-gift,"The sea lay before him like a big fish tank, out of which he hauled as many as he required; and the cow continued to fend for herself."
the-sea-king-gift,"In autumn, when Matte and Maie went ashore, the cow went to sea, and in spring, when they returned to the rock, there she stood awaiting them."
the-sea-king-gift,"'We shall require a better house,' said Maie the following summer; 'the old one is too small for ourselves and the men.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Yes,' said Matte."
the-sea-king-gift,"So he built a large cottage, with a real lock to the door, and a store-house for fish as well; and he and his men caught such quantities of fish that they sent tons of salmon, herring, and cod to Russian and Sweden."
the-sea-king-gift,"'I am quite overworked with so many folk,' said Maie; 'a girl to help me would not come amiss.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Get one, then,' said her husband; and so they hired a girl."
the-sea-king-gift,"Then Maie said: 'We have too little milk for all these folk. Now that I have a servant, with the same amount of trouble she could look after three cows.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'All right, then,' said her husband, somewhat provoked, 'you can sing a song to the fairies.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"This annoyed Maie, but nevertheless she rowed out to sea on Sunday night and sang as before: Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard, Who dwellest in the deep blue sea, A thousand cows are in thy herd, I pray thee give three unto me."
the-sea-king-gift,"The following morning, instead of one, three cows stood on the island, and they all ate seaweed and fended for themselves like the first one."
the-sea-king-gift,'Art thou satisfied now?' said Matte to his wife.
the-sea-king-gift,"'I should be quite satisfied,' said his wife, 'if only I had two servants to help, and if I had some finer clothes. Don't you know that I am addressed as Madam?' ' Well, well,' said her husband."
the-sea-king-gift,So Maie got several servants and clothes fit for a great lady.
the-sea-king-gift,"'Everything would now be perfect if only we had a little better dwelling for summer. You might build us a two-storey house, and fetch soil to make a garden. Then you might make a little arbour up there to let us have a sea-view; and we might have a fiddler to fiddle to us of an evening, and a little steamer to take us to church in stormy weather.'"
the-sea-king-gift,'Anything more?' asked Matte; but he did everything that his wife wished.
the-sea-king-gift,The rock Ahtola became so grand and Maie so grand that all the sea-urchins and herring were lost in wonderment.
the-sea-king-gift,Even Prince was fed on beefsteaks and cream scones till at last he was as round as a butter jar.
the-sea-king-gift,'Are you satisfied now?' asked Matte.
the-sea-king-gift,"'I should be quite satisfied,' said Maie, 'if only I had thirty cows. At least that number is required for such a household.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Go to the fairies,' said Matte."
the-sea-king-gift,His wife set out in the new steamer and sang to the sea-king.
the-sea-king-gift,"Next morning thirty cows stood on the shore, all finding food for themselves."
the-sea-king-gift,"'Know'st thou, good man, that we are far too cramped on this wretched rock, and where am I to find room for so many cows?'"
the-sea-king-gift,'There is nothing to be done but to pump out the sea.'
the-sea-king-gift,'Rubbish!' said his wife.
the-sea-king-gift,"' Who can pump out the sea?' 'Try with thy new steamer, there is a pump in it.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"Maie knew well that her husband was only making fun of her, but still her mind was set upon the same subject."
the-sea-king-gift,"'I never could pump the sea out,' thought she, 'but perhaps I might fill it up, if I were to make a big dam. I might heap up sand and stones, and make our island as big again.'"
the-sea-king-gift,Maie loaded her boat with stones and went out to sea.
the-sea-king-gift,"The fiddler was with her, and fiddled so finely that Ahti and Wellamos and all the sea's daughters rose to the surface of the water to listen to the music."
the-sea-king-gift,'What is that shining so brightly in the waves?' asked Maie.
the-sea-king-gift,"'That is sea foam glinting in the sunshine,' answered the fiddler."
the-sea-king-gift,"'Throw out the stones,' said Maie."
the-sea-king-gift,"The people in the boat began to throw out the stones, splash, splash, right and left, into the foam."
the-sea-king-gift,"One stone hit the nose of Wellamos's chief lady-in-waiting, another scratched the sea queen herself on the cheek, a third plumped close to Ahti's head and tore off half of the sea-king's beard; then there was a commotion in the sea, the waves bubbled and bubbled like boiling water in a pot"
the-sea-king-gift,'Whence comes this gust of wind?' said Maie; and as she spoke the sea opened and swallowed up the steamer.
the-sea-king-gift,"Maie sank to the bottom like a stone, but, stretching out her arms and legs, she rose to the surface, where she found the fiddler's fiddle, and used it as a float."
the-sea-king-gift,"At the same moment she saw close beside her the terrible head of Ahti, and he had only half a beard!"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Why did you throw stones at me?' roared the sea-king. ' Oh, your majesty, it was a mistake! Put some bear's grease on your beard and that will soon make it grow again.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Dame, did I not give you all you asked for--nay, even more?' 'Truly, truly, your majesty. Many thanks for the cows.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'Well, where is the gold from the sun and the silver from the moon that you promised me?' ' Ah, your majesty, they have been scattered day and night upon the sea, except when the sky was overcast,' slyly answered Maie."
the-sea-king-gift,'I'll teach you!' roared the sea-king; and with that he gave the fiddle such a 'puff' that it sent the old woman up like a sky-rocket on to her island.
the-sea-king-gift,"There Prince lay, as famished as ever, gnawing the carcase of a crow."
the-sea-king-gift,"There sat Matte in his ragged grey jacket, quite alone, on the steps of the old hut, mending a net."
the-sea-king-gift,"'Heavens, mother,' said he, 'where are you coming from at such a whirlwind pace, and what makes you in such a dripping condition?'"
the-sea-king-gift,"Maie looked around her amazed, and said, 'Where is our two-storey house?' ' What house?' asked her husband."
the-sea-king-gift,"' Our big house, and the flower garden, and the men and the maids, and the thirty beautiful cows, and the steamer, and everything else?'"
the-sea-king-gift,"'You are talking nonsense, mother,' said he. ' The students have quite turned your head, for you sang silly songs last evening while we were rowing, and then you could not sleep till early morning. We had stormy weather during the night, and when it was past I did not wish to waken you, so rowed out alone to rescue the net.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"' But I've seen Ahti,' rejoined Maie. ' You've been lying in bed, dreaming foolish fancies, mother, and then in your sleep you walked into the water.'"
the-sea-king-gift,"' But there is the fiddle,' said Maie. ' A fine fiddle! It is only an old stick. No, no, old woman, another time we will be more careful. Good luck never attends fishing on a Sunday.'"
